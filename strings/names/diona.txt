Rain Falling Upon The Tin Roof
Driving Alone Upon The Road
Combusting Bar From The Flames
Party Dancing With Friends
Planetary Nuclear Armageddon
Cogs Turning In A Cold Steel Tower
Trees Screaming In A Grey Forest
A Sad Song Upon The Green Hills
Oil Rigs Draining Into Brittle Earth
Floating Through Space Watching The Stars
Waves Falling Upon The Coarse Sand
Looking Through The Eyes Of Stone
The Lonesome Ringing Of A Church Bell
Slightly-burnt Marshmallows Above A Warm Campfire
Hellfire Raining Down From The Sky
Rustling Of Papers From An Office
A Parable Told Upon A Bed By A Parent
The Thrill Of Alcohol Upon The Road
A Warm Meal Above A Fireplace Softly Bubbling
Crawling Through The Dungeons As A Youth
Scavenging Spare Parts Upon The Scrapyard
The Noisy Turning Of Gears In The Walls
The Anxious Feeling From Staring Into Space
The Light In The Darkness
The Siren's Song Calling Upon The Sea
An Endless Battle Within A Mind
Watching Paint Dry After A Long Day
Rolling In On The Open Road
The Howling Of Wolves Below The Moon
The Feeling Of Being Invisible In The Crowd
Crossing The Street With Hands Held
The Noise Of Gunfire Tearing Through The Mall
The Sound Of Echoing Silence In The Graveyard
Listening To A Nostaligc Song On The Radio
Tuning Into The Radio Static
Lounging In An Armchair As Time Flies Past
Swans Dancing In The Lake
The Stars Gazing Back On A Lonely Night
Putting Out A Flame As Voices Cheer
Puffing Out Smoke After A Cold Day
Playful Crunching Of Snow In A Dreary Winter
The Melancholic Whistling Of The Wind
Shaking Hands With An Old Friend
Reuniting With Those Whom I Love
Tinkering Joyfully With Gadgets
Starting A Most Fearsome Revolution
A Rat Prowling In The Inner Circle
The Smell Of Sultry Food
Soft Echoes Within The Cavernous Cargo Bay
Violent Rain Crashing Down Upon The Soft Tin Roof
Modest Tragedy In The Old-fashioned District
Serene Quiet In The Young Spring Forest
Tranquil River Under The Frosted Mountain
Whispering Insects In The Moonlit Garden
Twisting Flames Within The Dying Canopy
Melting Ice Upon The Ponds Frozen Face
Distant Thunder Booming On The Silent Night
Muddy Water Burbling Softly Within The Brook
Whispering Winds Tearing At The Clattering Rooftop
Spices Floating Softly In The Kitchen Air
Echoing Laughter Atop The Ferris Wheel
Gentle Spring Breeze Wafting The Canopy
Dancing Upon The Muddy Puddle
Fading Memories Drifting With Sickness
Forgotten Dreams From A Frightful Slumber
Whispers Carried Upon The Starlight Night
Nibbles Of Fried Dough With A Friend
Scorching Sun Beating Upon The Desert Sands
Softly Unearthing A Long Dead History
Violent Clattering Of Dishware In The Kitchen
Chirping Nymphs As They Explore
Brushing Against Asteroids In Orbit
Distant Explosion Of Flame As We Watch On
Gazing Upon The Destruction Wrought By War
Basking Upon A Warm Rock In A Pleasant Summer
Glowing Embers Of Infrared Upon The Rock-face
Tottering Towers Of Terracotta Drying Away
Stretching Antennea Beneath The Cool Sun
Throwing A Toy In Anger As A Child
Bountiful Harvest Of Swift Sunlight
Catching Motes Of Gas In The Void Of Space
Playfully Chasing Through The Fading Fall Flowers
Sorrowfully Staring Upon The Sparkling Starscape
Sacred Waters Burbling Softly Near The Temple
Dropping A Sugary Treat Upon The Carnival Ground
A First Patient Perishing Beneath Our Care
Unearthing Buried Treasure Within The Earth
Serenly Meditating Within The Humming Hall
Digging In Sand With Newly Formed Limbs
Childish Fright Of Foolish Things
Being Frightened Of An Oddly Shaped Rock
Catching The Twirling Seedpods Drifting Softly
Discovering A Forgotten Path In A Meadow
The Joy Of Finding A Childhood Toy
Flowers Blooming For The Freshly Risen Sun
Flush With Chloroplasts In Preperation For Dawn
Harsh Words Heard Through The Thin Walls
Marvelling Upon The Misty Drifting In Moonlight
Morning Dew Sticking To Leaves
Ferns Unfurling With Spores Softly Drifting
Rainy Night Gifting Life To The Desert Air
Heat Of The Sun Upon Body
Water Falling From The Sky
Leaves Rustling In Winds
Watching Night Turn To Day
Doors Opening For The First Time
First Song Heard From Parent
Losing First Friend
Adventuring Out From Parent
Splitting From Gestalt
Playing Under The Grass
Hiding Beneath Couch
Experiencing The Cold Snow
Learning The First Song
Feeling Of Growth After First Split
Hidden Beneath Rock
Digging Into Soil
Finding A New Friend
Basking In Sun
Learning How To Exist
First Meal After First Day
Creating A Gestalt
Discovering A Bug
Enjoying The Hot Sun
Loud Noises From The Sky
Fright After Noises
Running Behind A Plant
Singing For The First Time
Joining A Chorus
Sight Of Stars
