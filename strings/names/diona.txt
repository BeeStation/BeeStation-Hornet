Rain Falling Upon The Tin Roof
Driving Alone Upon The Road
Combusting Bar From The Flames
Party Dancing With Friends
Planetary Nuclear Armageddon
Cogs Turning In A Cold Steel Tower
Trees Screaming In A Grey Forest
A Sad Song Upon The Green Hills
Oil Rigs Draining Into Brittle Earth
Floating Through Space Watching The Stars
Waves Falling Upon The Coarse Sand
Looking Through The Eyes Of Stone
The Lonesome Ringing Of A Church Bell
Slightly-Burnt Marshmallows Above A Warm Campfire
Hellfire Raining Down from the Sky
Rustling Of Papers From An Office
A Parable Told Upon A Bed by a Parent
The Thrill of Alcohol upon the Road
A Warm Meal Above A Fireplace Softly Bubbling
Crawling Through The Dungeons As a Youth
Scavenging Spare Parts Upon The Scrapyard
The Noisy Turning Of Gears in the Walls
The Anxious Feeling From Staring Into Space
The Light In The Darkness
The Siren's Song Calling Upon The Sea
An Endless Battle Within a Mind
Watching Paint Dry After a Long Day
Rolling In On The Open Road
The Howling Of Wolves Below the Moon
The Feeling Of Being Invisible in the Crowd
Crossing The Street with Hands Held
The Noise of Gunfire Tearing through The Mall
The Sound Of Echoing Silence in the Graveyard
Listening To a Nostaligc Song on the Radio
Tuning Into The Radio Static
Lounging In An Armchair As Time Flies Past
Swans Dancing In The Lake
The Stars Gazing Back on a Lonely Night
Putting Out A Flame As Voices Cheer
Puffing Out Smoke After A Cold Day
Playful Crunching Of Snow In a Dreary Winter
The Melancholic Whistling Of The Wind
Shaking Hands With An Old Friend
Reuniting With Those Whom I Love
Tinkering Joyfully With Gadgets
Starting A Most Fearsome Revolution
A Rat Prowling In The Inner Circle
The Smell Of Sultry Food
Melting Ice Upon the Ponds Frozen Face
Distant Thunder Booming on the Silent Night
