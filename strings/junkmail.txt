Strange how some of the largest servers are erp server, most with large amounts of anthro characters and even high level of customisation, do you not think that there exists a population of furries that dont erp and simply want to play ss13? do you think that every furry is extremely public of what fandom they are in espiecally in a fandom as hated as furry in a fandom as toxic as ss13? you simply deny the fact that you live, robust and get robusted by the same people who put on suits of fur. wake up sheeple. The world is wider than you think. The horizon isnt the end. The degenerates arent the only ones. if you play non-humans for non-powergamey reasons, what makes you different from the men of fur?
The Felinid main is immunized against all dangers: one may call him a scoundrel, parasite, swindler, profiteer, it all runs off him like water off a raincoat. But call him a metagamer and you will be astonished at how he recoils, how injured he is, how he suddenly shrinks back: “I’ve been found out.”
just joining to say that because of the unfairness i'm quitting the station forever, if you want to know why feel free to message me, but i wouldn't be suprised if no one even saw this message, no one ever sees what i say.
I used the shotgun. You know why? Cause the shot gun doesn't miss, and unlike the shitty hybrid taser it stops a criminal in their tracks in two hits. Bang, bang, and they're fucking done. I use four shots just to make damn sure. Because, once again, I'm not there to coddle a buncha criminal scum sucking [redacted by nanotransen ethics committee], I'm there to 1) Survive the fucking round. 2) Guard the armory. So you can absolutely get fucked. If I get unbanned, which I won't, you can guarantee I will continue to use the shotgun to apprehend criminals. Because it's quick, clean and effective as fuck. Why in the seven hells would I fuck around with the disabler shots, which take half a clip just to bring someone down, or with the tazer bolts which are slow as balls, impossible to aim and do about next to jack shit, fuck all. The shotgun is the superior law enforcement weapon. Because it stops crime. And it stops crime by reducing the number of criminals roaming the fucking halls.
it's a deep running social commentary on the state of the game. Juxteposing the happy-go-lucky visage of a clownfish with the deeply scarred underside, branded as sus by his peers. The new mascot represents a new era for beestation, not forgetting our past, or any subset of the playerbase, but integrating them all into the new, and improved, windows 98 powered experience Signed ~Tom Beestation, Apidyne Industries ®️.
