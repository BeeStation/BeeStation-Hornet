<h1>I used the shotgun.</h1><br> <i>You know why?</i> Cause the shot gun doesn't miss, and unlike the shitty hybrid taser it stops a criminal in their tracks in two hits. <b>Bang, bang,<i> and they're fucking done.</i></b><br> I use four shots just to make damn sure. Because, once again, I'm not there to coddle a buncha criminal scum sucking <i>[redacted by nanotransen ethics committee]</i>, I'm there to <ol><li>Survive the fucking round.</li> <li> Guard the armory.</li></ol> So you can absolutely get fucked.<br> <b>If I get unbanned</b>, <i>which I won't</i>, you can guarantee I will continue to use the shotgun to apprehend criminals.<br> Because it's quick, clean and effective as fuck. Why in the seven hells would I fuck around with the disabler shots, which take half a clip just to bring someone down, or with the tazer bolts which are slow as balls, impossible to aim and do about next to jack shit, fuck all.<br> <h2><b>The shotgun is the superior law enforcement weapon.</h2></b><br> Because it stops crime. And it stops crime by reducing the number of criminals roaming the fucking halls.
