Remember, tickets & food to the Toolbox Tournament aren't cheap. That money in union dues you'd be paying every year could sure go a long way.
Remember, nothing's more enjoyable than a night out watching a thunderdome match with your buddies. All those union dues you pay every year could buy a few rounds.
Nanotrasen's open door policy is designed to help you feel comfortable taking up issues to your assigned head of staff. It's hard for us to maintain this when they're dead.
