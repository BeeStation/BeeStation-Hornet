# BYOND Savefile Converter
Tool to assist with migrating savefiles to database

Setup is easy: update the settings in _defines.dm to set directory to pull saves from and DB creds, then compile and run it. Tail the log file for live feedback on the migration process.

Built by MCterra. Utilizes a bunch of mix and matched code from the main repo to do stuff, as well as rust_g for DB queries.
