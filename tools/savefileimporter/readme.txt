This contains a savefile converter to move from BYOND savefiles to DB tables.

1. Ensure you have applied the relevant DB migration first (TODO: put revision here).
2. Copy rust_g.dll from the project root to this dir.
3. Copy config.example.json to config.json and fill out relevant info.
4. Build this project and press go on it
5. Go make a coffee. It will take like 10 minutes.

If you have troubles with this, let me (affectedarc07) know.
