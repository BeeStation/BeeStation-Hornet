# TGUI Backend Documentation

## Main concepts

Basic tgui backend code consists of defining a few procs. In these procs
you will handle a request to open or update a UI (typically by updating a UI
if it exists or setting up and opening it if it does not), a request for data,
in which you build a list to be passed as JSON to the UI, and an action
handler, which handles any user input.

- The atom, which UI corresponds to in the game world, is in most cases
known as the `src_object`.
- Frontend data is built in `ui_data` proc, which munges whatever complex
data your `src_object` has into a list.
- The action/topic handler, `ui_act`, is what recieves input from the user
and acts on it.
- The request/update proc, `ui_interact` is where you open your UI and set
options like title, size, autoupdate, theme, and more.
- Finally, `ui_state` (set in `ui_interact`) dictates under what conditions
a UI may be interacted with. This may be the standard checks that check if
you are in range and conscious, or more.

Once backend is complete, you create an new interface component on the
frontend, which will receive this JSON data and render it on screen.

States are easy to write and extend, and what make tgui interactions so
powerful. Because states can be overridden from other procs, you can build
powerful interactions for embedded objects or remote access.

## Using It

### Backend

Let's start with a very basic hello world.

```dm
/obj/machinery/my_machine/ui_interact(mob/user, ui_key = "main", datum/tgui/ui = null, force_open = 0, datum/tgui/master_ui = null, datum/ui_state/state = default_state)
  ui = SStgui.try_update_ui(user, src, ui_key, ui, force_open)
  if(!ui)
    ui = new(user, src, ui_key, "my_machine", name, 300, 300, master_ui, state)
    ui.open()
```

This is the proc that defines our interface. There's a bit going on here, so
let's break it down. First, we override the ui_interact proc on our object. This
will be called by `interact` for you, which is in turn called by `attack_hand`
(or `attack_self` for items). `ui_interact` is also called to update a UI (hence
the `try_update_ui`), so we accept an existing UI to update. The `state` is a
default argument so that a caller can overload it with named arguments
(`ui_interact(state = overloaded_state)`) if needed.

Inside the `if(!ui)` block (which means we are creating a new UI), we choose our
template, title, and size; we can also set various options like `style` (for
themes), or autoupdate. These options will be elaborated on later (as will
`ui_state`s).

After `ui_interact`, we need to define `ui_data`. This just returns a list of
data for our object to use. Let's imagine our object has a few vars:

```dm
/obj/machinery/my_machine/ui_data(mob/user)
  var/list/data = list()
  data["health"] = health
  data["color"] = color

  return data
```

The `ui_data` proc is what people often find the hardest about tgui, but its
really quite simple! You just need to represent your object as numbers, strings,
and lists, instead of atoms and datums.

Finally, the `ui_act` proc is called by the interface whenever the user used an
input. The input's `action` and `params` are passed to the proc.

```dm
/obj/machinery/my_machine/ui_act(action, params)
  if(..())
    return
  switch(action)
    if("change_color")
      var/new_color = params["color"]
      if(!(color in allowed_coors))
        return
      color = new_color
      . = TRUE
  update_icon()
```

The `..()` (parent call) is very important here, as it is how we check that the
user is allowed to use this interface (to avoid so-called href exploits). It is
also very important to clamp and sanitize all input here. Always assume the user
is attempting to exploit the game.

Also note the use of `. = TRUE` (or `FALSE`), which is used to notify the UI
that this input caused an update. This is especially important for UIs that do
not auto-update, as otherwise the user will never see their change.

### Frontend

Finally, you have to make a UI component. This is also a source of
confusion for many new users. If you got some basic javascript and HTML
knowledge, that should ease the learning process, although we recommend
getting yourself introduced to
[React and JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html).

A component is not a regular HTML. A component is a pure function, which
accepts a `props` object (it contains properties passed to a component),
and outputs an HTML-like structure consisting of regular HTML elements and
other UI components.

Interface component will always receive 1 prop which is called `state`.
This object contains a few special values:

- `config` is always the same and is part of core tgui
(it will be explained later),
- `data` is the data returned from `ui_data`
- `adata` is the same, but with certain values (numbers at this time)
interpolated in order to allow animation.

```jsx
import { Section, LabeledList } from '../components';

const SampleInterface = props => {
  // Extract state from props
  const { state } = props;
  // Extract config and data from the state
  const { config, data } = state;
  // Extract window reference (will be used later for dispatching actions)
  const { ref } = config;
  // Return the Virtual DOM
  return (
    <Section title="Health status">
      <LabeledList>
        <LabeledList.Item label="Health">
          {data.health}
        </LabeledList.Item>
        <LabeledList.Item label="Color">
          {data.color}
        </LabeledList.Item>
      </LabeledList>
    </Section>
  );
};
```

This syntax can be very confusing at first, but it is very important to
realize that this is just a natural extension of javascript. This syntax
simply creates a Virtual DOM object, which you can treat as any other
object in javascript. Here are some control flow examples:

Returning different elements based on a condition:

```jsx
if (condition) {
  return <Foo />;
}
return <Bar />;
```

Conditionally rendering a element inside of another element:

```jsx
<Box>
  {showProgress && (
    <ProgressBar value={progress} />
  )}
</Box>
```

Looping over the array to make element for each item:

```jsx
<LabeledList>
  {items.map(item => (
    <LabeledList.Item key={item.id} label={item.label}>
      {item.content}
    </LabeledList.Item>
  ))}
</LabeledList>
```

## Copypasta

We all do it, even the best of us. If you just want to make a tgui **fast**,
here's what you need (note that you'll probably be forced to clean your shit up
upon code review):

```dm
/obj/copypasta/ui_interact(mob/user, ui_key = "main", datum/tgui/ui = null, force_open = 0, datum/tgui/master_ui = null, datum/ui_state/state = default_state) // Remember to use the appropriate state.
  ui = SStgui.try_update_ui(user, src, ui_key, ui, force_open)
  if(!ui)
    ui = new(user, src, ui_key, "copypasta", name, 300, 300, master_ui, state)
    ui.open()

/obj/copypasta/ui_data(mob/user)
  var/list/data = list()
  data["var"] = var

  return data

/obj/copypasta/ui_act(action, params)
  if(..())
    return
  switch(action)
    if("copypasta")
      var/newvar = params["var"]
      var = Clamp(newvar, min_val, max_val) // Just a demo of proper input sanitation.
      . = TRUE
  update_icon() // Not applicable to all objects.
```

And the template:

```jsx
import { Section, LabeledList } from '../components';

const SampleInterface = props => {
  // Extract state from props
  const { state } = props;
  // Extract config and data from the state
  const { config, data } = state;
  // Extract window reference (will be used later for dispatching actions)
  const { ref } = config;
  // Return the Virtual DOM
  return (
    <Section title="Section name">
      <LabeledList>
        <LabeledList.Item label="Variable">
          {data.var}
        </LabeledList.Item>
      </LabeledList>
    </Section>
  );
};
```
