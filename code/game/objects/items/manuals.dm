				<h3>Growing Humans</h3>

				Why would you want to grow humans? Well I'm expecting most readers to be in the slave trade, but a few might actually
				want to revive fallen comrades. Growing pod people is easy, but prone to disaster.
				<p>
				<ol>
				<li>Find a dead person who is in need of cloning. </li>
				<li>Take a blood sample with a syringe. </li>
				<li>Inject a seed pack with the blood sample. </li>
				<li>Plant the seeds. </li>
				<li>Tend to the plants water and nutrition levels until it is time to harvest the cloned human.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
				It really is that easy! Good luck!

				<h1>Food for Dummies</h1>
				Here is a guide on basic food recipes and also how to not poison your customers accidentally.


				<h2>Basic ingredients preparation:</h2>

				<b>Dough:</b> 10u water + 15u flour for simple dough.<br>
				15u egg yolk + 15u flour + 5u sugar for cake batter.<br>
				Doughs can be transformed by using a knife and rolling pin.<br>
				All doughs can be microwaved.<br>
				<b>Bowl:</b> Add water to it for soup preparation.<br>
				<b>Meat:</b> Microwave it, process it, slice it into microwavable cutlets with your knife, or use it raw.<br>
				<b>Cheese:</b> Add 5u universal enzyme (catalyst) to milk and soy milk to prepare cheese (sliceable) and tofu.<br>
				<b>Rice:</b> Mix 10u rice with 10u water in a bowl then microwave it.

				<h2>Custom food:</h2>
				Add ingredients to a base item to prepare a custom meal.<br>
				The bases are:<br>
				- bun (burger)<br>
				- breadslices(sandwich)<br>
				- plain bread<br>
				- plain pie<br>
				- vanilla cake<br>
				- empty bowl (salad)<br>
				- bowl with 10u water (soup)<br>
				- boiled spaghetti<br>
				- pizza bread<br>
				- iron rod (kebab)

				<h2>Table Craft:</h2>
				Put ingredients on table, then click and drag the table onto yourself to see what recipes you can prepare.

				<h2>Microwave:</h2>
				Use it to cook or boil food ingredients (meats, doughs, egg, spaghetti, donkpocket, etc...).
				It can cook multiple items at once.

				<h2>Processor:</h2>
				Use it to process certain ingredients (meat into meatball, doughslice into spaghetti, potato into fries,etc...)

				<h2>Gibber:</h2>
				Stuff an animal in it to grind it into meat.

				<h2>Meat spike:</h2>
				Stick an animal on it then begin collecting its meat.


				<h2>Example recipes:</h2>
				<b>Vanilla Cake</b>: Microwave cake batter.<br>
				<b>Burger:</b> 1 bun + 1 meat steak<br>
				<b>Bread:</b> Microwave dough.<br>
				<b>Waffles:</b> 2 pastry base<br>
				<b>Popcorn:</b> Microwave corn.<br>
				<b>Meat Steak:</b> Microwave meat.<br>
				<b>Meat Pie:</b> 1 plain pie + 1u black pepper + 1u salt + 2 meat cutlets<br>
				<b>Boiled Spagetti:</b> Microwave spaghetti.<br>
				<b>Donuts:</b> 1u sugar + 1 pastry base<br>
				<b>Fries:</b> Process potato.

				<h2>Sharing your food:</h2>
				You can put your meals on your kitchen counter or load them in the snack vending machines.

			Nuclear Explosives 101:<br>
			Hello and thank you for choosing the Syndicate for your nuclear information needs.<br>
			Today's crash course will deal with the operation of a Fusion Class Nanotrasen made Nuclear Device.<br>
			First and foremost, DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING UNTIL THE BOMB IS IN PLACE.<br>
			Pressing any button on the compacted bomb will cause it to extend and bolt itself into place.<br>
			If this is done to unbolt it one must completely log in which at this time may not be possible.<br>
			To make the nuclear device functional:<br>
			<li>Place the nuclear device in the designated detonation zone.</li>
			<li>Extend and anchor the nuclear device from its interface.</li>
			<li>Insert the nuclear authorisation disk into slot.</li>
			<li>Type numeric authorisation code into the keypad. This should have been provided. Note: If you make a mistake press R to reset the device.
			<li>Press the E button to log onto the device.</li>
			You now have activated the device. To deactivate the buttons at anytime for example when you've already prepped the bomb for detonation	remove the auth disk OR press the R on the keypad.<br>
			Now the bomb CAN ONLY be detonated using the timer. Manual detonation is not an option.<br>
			Note: Nanotrasen is a pain in the neck.<br>
			Toggle off the SAFETY.<br>
			Note: You wouldn't believe how many Syndicate Operatives with doctorates have forgotten this step.<br>
			So use the - - and + + to set a det time between 5 seconds and 10 minutes.<br>
			Then press the timer toggle button to start the countdown.<br>
			Now remove the auth. disk so that the buttons deactivate.<br>
			Note: THE BOMB IS STILL SET AND WILL DETONATE<br>
			Now before you remove the disk if you need to move the bomb you can:<br>
			Toggle off the anchor, move it, and re-anchor.<br><br>
			Good luck. Remember the order:<br>
			<b>Disk, Code, Safety, Timer, Disk, RUN!</b><br>
			Intelligence Analysts believe that normal Nanotrasen procedure is for the Captain to secure the nuclear authorisation disk.<br>
			Good luck!
