				<HR>
				<b>Implant Details:</b> <BR>
				<b>Function:</b> Continuously transmits low power signal. Useful for tracking.<BR>
				<b>Special Features:</b><BR>
				<i>Neuro-Safe</i>- Specialized shell absorbs excess voltages self-destructing the chip if
				a malfunction occurs thereby securing safety of subject. The implant will melt and
				disintegrate into bio-safe elements.<BR>
				<b>Integrity:</b> Gradient creates slight risk of being overcharged and frying the
				circuitry. As a result neurotoxins can cause massive damage."}
