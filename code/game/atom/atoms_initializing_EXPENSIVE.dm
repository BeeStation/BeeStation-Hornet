  *
  * During roundstart map parsing, atoms are queued for intialization in the base atom/New(),
  * After the map has loaded, then Initalize is called on all atoms one by one. NB: this
  * is also true for loading map templates as well, so they don't Initalize until all objects
  * in the map file are parsed and present in the world
  *
  * If you're creating an object at any point after SSInit has run then this proc will be
  * immediately be called from New.
  *
  * mapload: This parameter is true if the atom being loaded is either being intialized during
  * the Atom subsystem intialization, or if the atom is being loaded from the map template.
  * If the item is being created at runtime any time after the Atom subsystem is intialized then
  * it's false.
  *
  * You must always call the parent of this proc, otherwise failures will occur as the item
  * will not be seen as initalized (this can lead to all sorts of strange behaviour, like
  * the item being completely unclickable)
  *
  * You must not sleep in this proc, or any subprocs
  *
  * Any parameters from new are passed through (excluding loc), naturally if you're loading from a map
  * there are no other arguments
  *
  * Must return an [initialization hint](code/__DEFINES/subsystems.html) or a runtime will occur.
  *
