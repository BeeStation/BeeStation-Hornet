 * GAMEMODES (by Rastaf0)

 * In the new mode system all special roles are fully supported.
 * You can have proper wizards/traitors/changelings/cultists during any mode.
 * Only two things really depends on gamemode:
 * 1. Starting roles, equipment and preparations
 * 2. Conditions of finishing the round.
