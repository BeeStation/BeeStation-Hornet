# Objectives

**Basic:** Contains a list of simple, objectives with a single goal and a simple win condition.
If an objective is exactly what it says on the tin, it goes here. If the objective will not work
with any other antagonist roles, put it in its own folder. If it is a generic objective, put it
along with everything else.

**Finale:** The round ending objective. You can only have one of these generally. Includes escaping,
destroying the station, hijacking, dying and surviving.

**Open:** Objectives that have a lot more lee-way for their completion. You still have to do *something*
towards them, but they are not perfectly tracked. These exist to give more freedom to the objectives.
