/**
 * # Families gamemode / dynamic ruleset handler
 *
 * A special datum used by the families gamemode and dynamic rulesets to centralize code. "Family" and "gang" used interchangeably in code.
 *
 * This datum centralizes code used for the families gamemode / dynamic rulesets. Families incorporates a significant
 * amount of unique processing; without this datum, that could would be duplicated. To ensure the maintainability
 * of the families gamemode / rulesets, the code was moved to this datum. The gamemode / rulesets instance this
 * datum, pass it lists (lists are passed by reference; removing candidates here removes candidates in the gamemode),
 * and call its procs. Additionally, the families antagonist datum and families induction package also
 * contain vars that reference this datum, allowing for new families / family members to add themselves
 * to this datum's lists thereof (primarily used for point calculation). Despite this, the basic team mechanics
 * themselves should function regardless of this datum's instantiation, should a player have the gang or cop
 * antagonist datum added to them through methods external to the families gamemode / rulesets.
