/**
  * # Religious Sects
  *
  * Religious Sects are a way to convert the fun of having an active 'god' (admin) to code-mechanics so you aren't having to press adminwho.
  *
  * Sects are not meant to overwrite the fun of choosing a custom god/religion, but meant to enhance it.
  * The idea is that Space Jesus (or whoever you worship) can be an evil bloodgod who takes the lifeforce out of people, a nature lover, or all things righteous and good. You decide!
