* A dynamic reaction object that processes the reaction that it is set within it. Relies on a reagents holder to call and operate the functions.
*
* An object/datum to contain the vars for each of the reactions currently ongoing in a holder/reagents datum
* This way all information is kept within one accessable object
* equilibrium is a unique name as reaction is already too close to chemical_reaction
* This is set up this way to reduce holder.dm bloat as well as reduce confusing list overhead
* The crux of the fermimechanics are handled here
* Instant reactions AREN'T handled here. See holder.dm
