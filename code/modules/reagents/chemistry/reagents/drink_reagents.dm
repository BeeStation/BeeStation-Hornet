	* (target_units / total_cycles) + BHJ.metabolization_rate = amount_to_add = .44
	* However, regular livers process 1u per tick of any toxin if it is under 3u. This does not account for others, since most others are likely upgrades, and having a workaround for those upgrades defeats their purpose.
	* Meaning we need a starting amount to offset this which is more than three. Ideally this should yield the lowest amount of decimal spaces to save space, while being as low as possible.
	* In this case starting_amount = 5.
	* ( (target_units - starting_amount) / minimum_cycles) + BHJ.metabolization_rate = amount_to_add = .436
	* Copy pasting the above and changing /datum/reagent/toxin/bonehurtingjuice as well as the documentation to be accurate for another type path will work so long as the reagent using this has an OD threshold.
	* You can just change the target units and should double check that the starting amount meets outlined criteria.
