/**
 * ## Glass style singleton
 *
 * Used by [/datum/component/takes_reagent_appearance], and a few other places,
 * to modify the looks of a reagent container (not /reagent_containers, any atom with reagents)
 * when certain types of reagents are put into and become the majority reagent of the container
 *
 * For example, pouring Vodka into a glass will change its icon to look like the vodka glass sprite
 * while pouring it into a shot glass will change to the vodka shot glass sprite
 *
 * A reagent type can have multiple glass styles so long as each style is linked to a different container type,
 * this allows one reagent to style multiple things across a variety of icon files
