/**
 * Simple unit test to ensure there's no regression in behaviour where machine frames should not be stacked.
 *
 * We attempt to use the RCD to build multiple stacked machine frames on a turf. If we end up with any number that
 * is not equal to 1, this means we've either built no machine frames (bad) or built more than one (regression).
 *
 * If this is successful, we attempt to spawn in some no-density machines that result in machine frames and we run
 * the test again on our turf containing our single frame, deconstructing the machines! This should also not spawn
 * any stacked machine frames.
