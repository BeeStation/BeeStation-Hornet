/*
 * This test checks that all heretic knowledges that unlocks rituals
 * properly consume all used atoms and creates all resulting atoms.
 *
 * This test ONLY checks knowledges that unlock rituals which consume atoms and produce atoms.
 * - Rituals that consume atoms, but do not create any atoms (such as rituals of knowledge) are not tested.
 * - Summon rituals sleep after completing as they expect a ghost candidate to fill the summon, so they're skipped.
 * - Final rituals results in a bunch of side-effects and vary a good deal so they're skipped explicitly.
 * - Sacrifice ritual (Hunt and Sacrifice) requires sacrifice targets, as well as spawning a new z-level, so it's better not to test.
