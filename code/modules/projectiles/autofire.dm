/**
Full-auto firing by Kmc2000 (Version 2)
So it turns out the way I wrote this before was absolutely abysmal (who would've guessed!) this should be a little bit more clean and less buggy <3
Fields:
full_auto - Set this if you want a full auto setting on your gun. This REPLACES semi-auto, but don't fret! You can still use semi auto mode when on full auto, just don't hold your mouse down :)
It's highly recommended that you DO NOT use this for special case guns like the beam rifle, or guns that override mouseDown, as this will cause issues.
Everything else should be handled for you. Good luck soldier.
