# Types (also see terminology section)

-   openspace/multiplier -> shadows the below level, also copies lighting
-   openspace/mimic -> copies below movables
-   openspace/turf_proxy -> holds the appearance of the below turf for non-OVERWRITE Z-turfs
-   openspace/turf_mimic -> copies openspace/turf_proxy objects

# Public API:

## Notifying Z-Mimic of icon updates

-   UPDATE_OO_IF_PRESENT
    -   valid on movables only
    -   if this movable is being copied, update the copies
    -   cheap (if this movable is not being mimiced, this is a null check)
-   atom/update_above()
    -   similar to UPDATE_OO_IF_PRESENT, but for both turfs and movables
    -   less cheap (pretty much just proc-call overhead)

## Checking state

-   TURF_IS_MIMICKING(turf or any)
    -   value: bool - if the passed turf is z-mimic enabled
-   movable/get_above_oo()
    -   return: list of movables
    -   get a list of every openspace mimic that's copying this atom for things like animate()

## Changing state

-   turf/enable_zmimic(extra_flags = 0)
    -   return: bool - FALSE if this turf was already mimicking, TRUE otherwise
    -   Enables z-mimic for this turf, potentially adding extra z_flags.
    -   This will automatically queue the turf for update.
-   turf/disable_zmimic()
    -   return: bool - FALSE if this turf was not mimicking, TRUE otherwise
    -   Disables z-mimic for this turf.
    -   This will clean up associated mimic objects, but they may hang around for a few additional seconds.

## Vars

-   turf/z_flags
    -   bitfield
        -   ZM_MIMIC_BELOW: copy below atoms
        -   ZM_MIMIC_OVERWRITE: z-mimic can overwrite this turf's appearance
        -   ZM_ALLOW_LIGHTING: lighting should pass through this turf
        -   ZM_NO_OCCLUDE: don't block clicking on below atoms if not OVERWRITE
-   atom/movable/z_flags
    -   bitfield
        -   ZMM_IGNORE: Do not copy this atom. Atoms with INVISIBILITY_ABSTRACT are automatically not copied.
        -   ZMM_MANGLE_PLANES: Scan this atom's overlays and monkeypatch explicit plane sets. Fixes emissive overlays shining through floors, but expensive -- use only if necessary.

# Implementation details

Z-Mimic makes some assumptions. While it may continue to work if these are violated, don't be surprised if it behaves strangely, renders things in the incorrect order, or outright breaks.

## Assumptions

-   Z-Stacks will not be taller than OPENTURF_MAX_DEPTH.
    -   If violated: Warning emitted on boot, layering may break for items near the bottom of the z-stack.
-   Atoms will render correctly if copied to another plane.
-   Atoms will layer correctly if copied to the same plane as other arbitrary in-world atoms.
-   Atoms without ZMM_MANGLE_PLANES do not have any overlays that have explicit plane sets.
    -   If violated: Atoms on the below floor may be partially visible on the current floor.
-   Z-Stacks are 1:1 across the entire x/y plane.
    -   If violated: Z-turfs may form nonsensical connections.
-   Z-Stacks are contiguous and linear -- get_step(UP) corresponds to moving up a z-level (within a z-stack) in all cases.
    -   If violated: layering becomes nonsensical.
-   Z-Stacks will not be changed (note: adding new Z-stacks is OK) after an openturf has been initialized on that z-stack.
    -   If violated: Z-Turfs may act as if they are still connected even though they are not.
-   /turf/space is never above another turf type in the Z-Stack.
-   Turfs that are setting ZM_MIMIC_OVERWRITE do not care about their appearance.
    -   If violated: Appearance of turf is lost.
-   Multiturf movable atoms are symmetric, and centered on their visual center.
    -   If violated: Multitile atoms may not render in cases where they should.
-   SHADOWER_DARKENING_FACTOR and SHADOWER_DARKENING_COLOR represent the same shade of grey.
    -   If violated: unlit and lit z-turfs may look inconsistent with each other.
-   Lighting will mimic correctly without being associated with a plane.
    -   If violated: depending on implementation, lighting may be inverted, or not render at all.
    -   This can usually be addressed by changing /atom/movable/openspace/multiplier/proc/copy_lighting().

## Known Limitations

-   Multiturf movable atoms are not rendered if they are not centered on a z-turf, but overlap one.
-   vis_contents is ignored -- mimics will not copy it.

# Terminology (of varying obscurity)

-   Z-Stack
    -   A set of z-connected turfs with the same x/y coordinates.
-   Z-Depth
    -   How many Z-levels this atom is _from the top of a Z-Stack_ (absolute layering), regardless of z-turf presence
-   Shadower / Multiplier
    -   An abstract object used to darken lower levels, copy lighting, and host Z-AO overlays.
-   Mimic / Openspace Object
    -   An abstract object that holds appearances of atoms and proxies clicks.
-   Turf Proxy / Turf Object
    -   An abstract object that holds Z-Copy turf appearances for non-OVERWRITE turfs.
-   Turf Mimic
    -   An abstract object that holds appearances of non-OVERWRITE z-turfs below this z-turf.
-   Foreign Turf
    -   A turf below this z-turf that is contributing to our appearance.
-   Mimic Underlay
    -   A turf appearance holder specifically for fake space below a z-turf at the bottom of a z-stack.
