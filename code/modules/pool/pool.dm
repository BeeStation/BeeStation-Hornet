/**
How to pool!
Place pool turfs on the inside of your pool. This is where you swim. Pool end caps to cap it off on the north face
Place pool border decals around the pool so it doesn't look weird
Place a pool ladder at the top of the pool so that it leads to a normal tile (or else it'll be hard to get out of the pool.)
Place a pool filter somewhere in the pool if you want people to be able to modify the pool's settings (Temperature) or dump reagents into the pool (which'll change the pool's colour)
