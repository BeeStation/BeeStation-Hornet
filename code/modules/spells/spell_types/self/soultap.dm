 * SOUL TAP!
 *
 * Trades 20 max health for a refresh on all of your spells.
 * I was considering making it depend on the cooldowns of your spells, but I want to support "Big spell wizard" with this loadout.
 * The two spells that sound most problematic with this is mindswap and lichdom,
 * but soul tap requires clothes for mindswap and lichdom takes your soul.
