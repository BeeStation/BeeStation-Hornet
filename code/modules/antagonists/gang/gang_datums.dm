// Gang datums go here. If you want to create a new gang, you must be sure to edit:
// name
// color (must be a hex, "blue" isn't acceptable due to how spraycans are handled)
// hat/outfit/suit is the type of items that will count towards the points/scoring. Lists are nice and all, but they weren't really used at all... ever. And were just expensive
// You also need to make a gang graffiti, that will go in crayondecal.dmi inside our icons(not tg's), with the same name of the gang it's assigned to. Nothing else,just the icon.
// Those are all required. If one is missed, stuff could break.
