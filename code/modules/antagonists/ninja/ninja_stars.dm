/**
 * # Ninja Throwing Star
 *
 * a throwing star which specifically makes sure you know it came from a real ninja.
 *
 * The most important item in the entire codebase, as without it we would all cease to exist.
 * Inherits everything that makes it interesting the stamina throwing star, but the most
 * important change made is that its name specifically has the prefix, 'ninja' in it.
 * This provides the detective role with information to play off of by ensuring that his
 * assumption that a space ninja is aboard the ship to be true when he find 20 of these in
 * the captain's back.  Along with this, its throwforce is 10 instead of the 5 of the stamina
 * throwing star, meaning it'll do a little more damage than the stamina throwing star does as well.
 * Changes to this item need to be approved by all maintainers, so if you do change it, make sure
 * you go through the proper channels, lest you get permabanned.  Do I make myself clear?
