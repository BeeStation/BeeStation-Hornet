/**
 * Discordant Vassal
 *
 * Brujah-exclusive vassal type linked with the Brujah clan objective.
 * Has the goal of running their department (or station if they're a captain,) as anarchically as possible.
 * Doesn't follow the orders of the vampire who vassalized themâ€” they are still directed to not harm them though.
