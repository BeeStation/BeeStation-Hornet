	description = "Gangrel: Middle English, 'A vagabond; a drifter.' Possibly from gangen, 'to go.' Tied to Old Norse 'Gangleri,' a name for Odin meaning 'wanderer, wayfarer'.\n\n\
		These Nomads who hold closer ties to the wild places than most of their city-bound cousins, are also closer to the animal aspect of the Beast, and are masters of the Protean Discipline.\n\n\
		They were one of the seven founding clans of the Camarilla, but became disillusioned with the sect around 400 years ago, its elders eventually deciding to sever its ties and become an independent clan."
