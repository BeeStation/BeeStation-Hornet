	description = "In the (comparatively) little time since their founding, the Tremere have made incredible inroads within vampiric society and are arguably the most powerful clan in the modern nights.\n\n\
		This is due in no small part to their strict hierarchy, secretive nature, and mastery of Thaumaturgy, all of which elicit suspicion, fear, and respect from other Cainites.\n\n\
		The Tremere stand as a pillar of the Camarilla and are one of its main defenders, despite the fact that they exist almost as a subsect."
