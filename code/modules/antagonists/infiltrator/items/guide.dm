	info = "<b>Congratulations on the acquisition of your brand new Nanotrasen-tech-steal-inator!</b> <font size='1'>(patent pending)</font><br>\
			If you are reading this, you are most likely an elite syndicate infiltrator, tasked with \
			stealing some juicy tech points from Nanotrasen's brand new research station.<br><br> \
			<i>\"Well, what the hell do I do with this circuit board thing?\"</i> - You say.<br> \
			Do not be alarmed, dear agent, for the syndicate has prepared this SWEET guide for you!<br> \
			<b>Step 1:</b> Break into the research server room - Bring a hardsuit, we heard it's pretty chilly in there.<br> \
			<b>Step 2:</b> Use a screwdriver to open the maintenance panel of one of the servers.<br> \
			<b>Step 3:</b> Insert your <b>Nanotrasen-tech-steal-inator</b> in the server's \
			bluespace data recombobulation pipeline.*<br> \
			<b>Step 4:</b> Close the maintenance panel to avoid suspicion.<br> \
			You may repeat steps 2-4 if given more of this product. Be warned however, the more tech points \
			you steal per second, the more likely it is for a frustrated scientist to check the servers!<br> \
			<b>Step 5:</b> ???<br> \
			<b>Step 6: <font color='#00FF00'>GREENTEXT!</font></b><br><br> \
			*: The product will notify via the local syndicate frequency and shut itself down once your unit's \
			target tech points have been reached. Removal is not necessary.<br> \
			<font size='1'>Disclaimer: Contains small parts, keep away from children under 3. Warranty void if exposed to water or clown.</font>"
