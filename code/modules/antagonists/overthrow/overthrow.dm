// Mechanics wise, it's just 1 dude per team and he can convert maximum 2 more people of his choice, based on the implanter use var, Upon converting, the newly made guys are given access
// to a storage implant they came with when the Syndicate sent them aboard, with one random low-cost traitor item. The initial agent also has this. The only difference between
// initial agents and converted ones is that the initial agent has the items required to convert people and the AI.
