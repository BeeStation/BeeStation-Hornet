/**
 * Supermatter Surge
 *
 * An engineering challenge event where the properties of the SM changes to be in a 'surge' of power.
 * For the duration of the event a powerloss inhibition is added to nitrogen, causing the crystal to retain more of its internal energy.
 * Heat modifier is lowered to generate some heat but not a high temp burn.
 * Bullet energy from emitters is raised slightly to raise meV while turned on.
