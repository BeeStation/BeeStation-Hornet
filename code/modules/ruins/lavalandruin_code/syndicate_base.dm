This either means that the new Nanotransen space project is complete and operational in a nearby sector, or that Ashlanders have launched an assault on our base. We recommend you get rid of any pests and do not confuse them for humans.<br><br>In case you don't remember how to do your job, all you need is the equipment we provided; your Chameleon Mask, your Agent ID, and the intercom nearby. A nearby shelf contains all the names and jobs of the current Nanotransen employees. Assign their name and job to your ID, and your Mask will mimic the voice of whoever you are impersonating.<br><br>Oh, one more thing.
