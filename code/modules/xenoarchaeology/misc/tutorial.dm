	\n\
	It's pretty simple, just remember to wear your PPE. In-case you \
	forgot, that's your anti-tactile pinchers & science goggles, and \
	you'll probably want a labeler too.\n\
	\n\
	If you're going to label this for me, remember that you need to \
	label exactly 1 activator, 3 minors, and 1 major. I think some \
	of these things can develop malfunctions, I heard the green ones \
	even start with one too, so keep an eye out for that.\n\
	\n\
	After you've labeled it, correctly, you can hand it over to cargo, \
	to sell. The console will handle the rest.\n\

	\n\
	The AMC Mk.42 can be used to stabilize anomalous materials \
	through careful and percise operation. Stabilized materials will \
	not degrade any further, preventing potentially hazardous \
	malfunctions.\n\
	Successfully stabilizing materials will also yield valuable \
	research data.\n\
	\n\
	Operation is very simple, compared to the Mk.41. First, a labeled \
	material must be inserted into the reinforced chasis receptacle. \
	Then the AMC can be activated, to begin calibration. Properly \
	labeled samples will be stabilized, improperly labeled samples \
	will result in-."
