//The Great and Mighty CentCom Pod Launcher - MrDoomBringer
//This was originally created as a way to get adminspawned items to the station in an IC manner. It's evolved to contain a few more
//features such as item removal, smiting, controllable delivery mobs, and more.

//This works by creating a supplypod (refered to as temp_pod) in a special room in the centcom map.
//IMPORTANT: Even though we call it a supplypod for our purposes, it can take on the appearance and function of many other things: Eg. cruise missiles, boxes, or walking, living gondolas.
//When the user launched the pod, items from special "bays" on the centcom map are taken and put into the supplypod

//The user can change properties of the supplypod using the UI, and change the way that items are taken from the bay (One at a time, ordered, random, etc)
//Many of the effects of the supplypod set here are put into action in supplypod.dm
