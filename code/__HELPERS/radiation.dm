/// Radiation is performed by collecting all radiatables within the max range (0 means source only, 1 means adjacent, etc),
/// then makes their way towards them. A number, starting at 1, is multiplied
/// by the insulation amounts of whatever is in the way (for example, walls lowering it down).
/// If this number hits equal or below the threshold, then the target can no longer be irradiated.
/// If the number is above the threshold, then the chance is the chance that the target will be irradiated.
/// As a consumer, this means that max_range going up usually means you want to lower the threshold too,
/// as well as the other way around.
/// If max_range is high, but threshold is too high, then it usually won't reach the source at the max range in time.
/// If max_range is low, but threshold is too low, then it basically guarantees everyone nearby, even if there's walls
/// and such in the way, can be irradiated.
/// You can also pass in a minimum exposure time. If this is set, then this radiation pulse
/// will not irradiate the source unless they have been around *any* radioactive source for that
/// period of time.
