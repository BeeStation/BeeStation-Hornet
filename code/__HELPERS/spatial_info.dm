/** # Oranges Ear
 *
 * turns out view() spends a significant portion of its processing time generating lists of contents of viewable turfs which includes EVERYTHING on it visible
 * and the turf itself. there is an optimization to view() which makes it only iterate through either /obj or /mob contents, as well as normal list typechecking filters
 *
 * a fuckton of these are generated as part of its SS's init and stored in a list, when requested for a list of movables returned by the spatial grid or by some
 * superset of the final output that must be narrowed down by view(), one of these gets put on every turf that contains the movables that need filtering
 * and each is given references to the movables they represent. that way you can do for(var/mob/oranges_ear/ear in view(...)) and check what they reference
 * as opposed to for(var/atom/movable/target in view(...)) and checking if they have the properties you want which leads to much larger lists generated by view()
 * and also leads to iterating through more movables to filter them.
 *
 * TLDR: iterating through just mobs is much faster than all movables when iterating through view() on average, this system leverages that to boost speed
 * enough to offset the cost of allocating the mobs
 *
 * named because the idea was first made by oranges and i didnt know what else to call it (note that this system was originally made for get_hearers_in_view())
