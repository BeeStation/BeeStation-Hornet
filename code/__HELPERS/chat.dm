/*
Here's how to use the chat system with configs
send2adminchat is a simple function that broadcasts to admin channels
send2chat is a bit verbose but can be very specific
The second parameter is a string, this string should be read from a config.
What this does is dictacte which TGS4 channels can be sent to.
For example if you have the following channels in tgs4 set up
- Channel 1, Tag: asdf
- Channel 2, Tag: bombay,asdf
- Channel 3, Tag: Hello my name is asdf
- Channel 4, No Tag
- Channel 5, Tag: butts
and you make the call:
send2chat("I sniff butts", CONFIG_GET(string/where_to_send_sniff_butts))
and the config option is set like:
WHERE_TO_SEND_SNIFF_BUTTS asdf
It will be sent to channels 1 and 2
Alternatively if you set the config option to just:
WHERE_TO_SEND_SNIFF_BUTTS
it will be sent to all connected chats.
In TGS3 it will always be sent to all connected designated game chats.
