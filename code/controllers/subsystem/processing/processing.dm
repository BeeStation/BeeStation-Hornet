/**
  * This proc is called on a datum on every "cycle" if it is being processed by a subsystem. The time between each cycle is determined by the subsystem's "wait" setting.
  * You can start and stop processing a datum using the START_PROCESSING and STOP_PROCESSING defines.
  *
  * Since the wait setting of a subsystem can be changed at any time, it is important that any rate-of-change that you implement in this proc is multiplied by the delta_time that is sent as a parameter,
  * Additionally, any "prob" you use in this proc should instead use the DT_PROB define to make sure that the final probability per second stays the same even if the subsystem's wait is altered.
  * Examples where this must be considered:
  * - Implementing a cooldown timer, use `mytimer -= delta_time`, not `mytimer -= 1`. This way, `mytimer` will always have the unit of seconds
  * - Damaging a mob, do `L.adjustFireLoss(20 * delta_time)`, not `L.adjustFireLoss(20)`. This way, the damage per second stays constant even if the wait of the subsystem is changed
  * - Probability of something happening, do `if(DT_PROB(25, delta_time))`, not `if(prob(25))`. This way, if the subsystem wait is e.g. lowered, there won't be a higher chance of this event happening per second
  *
  * If you override this do not call parent, as it will return PROCESS_KILL. This is done to prevent objects that dont override process() from staying in the processing list
