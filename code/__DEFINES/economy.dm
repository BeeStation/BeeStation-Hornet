  * Note: The current intention for crazy amount of money to VIP is that they can be a rich shitter
  * or be targeted by antags for their money - oh, my, being rich isn't always good.

  * but if you decrease their payment too much, they'll be no longer interested.
  * I recommend to nerf their gimmick spawn chance instead.
