/*	Note: The current intention for crazy amount of money to VIP is that they can be a rich shitter
		  or be targeted by antags for their money - oh, my, being rich isn't always good.
		  The first buff to their money was to 2,000 credits. Nerf is fine if you think it's necessary,
		  but if you decrease their payment too much, they'll be no longer interested.
		  I recommend to nerf their gimmick spawn chance instead. */
