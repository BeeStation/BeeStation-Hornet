/*	<pill sprite size standard>
		Since sprite asset code crops the pill image, you are required to make a pill image within [11,10,21,20] squared area.
		There is a dummy image that you can recognise the size of a cropped pill image in 'pills.dmi'
		The black line counts, so you can use that area for your sprite as well.

	<what are the grey lines in the capsule example?>
		it's a margin that should exist for capsules because it looks bad in TGUI if there's no margin.
