/**
 *I feel the need to document what happens here. Basically this is used
 *catch rounding errors, and make gas go away in small portions.
 *People have raised it to higher levels in the past, do not do this. Consider this number a soft limit
 *If you're making gasmixtures that have unexpected behavior related to this value, you're doing something wrong.
 *
 *On an unrelated note this may cause a bug that creates negative gas, related to round(). When it has a second arg it will round up.
 *So for instance round(0.5, 1) == 1. I've hardcoded a fix for this into share, by forcing the garbage collect.
 *Any other attempts to fix it just killed atmos. I leave this to a greater man then I

 * Some further context on breakdown. Unlike dismantle, the breakdown ticker doesn't reset itself when a tile is added
 * This is because we cannot expect maps to have small spaces, so we need to even ourselves out often
 * We do this to avoid equalizing a large space in one tick, with some significant amount of say heat diff
 * This way large areas don't suddenly all become cold at once, it acts more like a wave
 *
 * Because of this and the behavior of share(), the breakdown cycles value can be tweaked directly to effect how fast we want gas to move
