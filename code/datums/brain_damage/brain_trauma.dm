//Brain Traumas are the new actual brain damage. Brain damage itself acts as a way to acquire traumas: every time brain damage is dealt, there's a chance of receiving a trauma.
//This chance gets higher the higher the mob's brainloss is. Removing traumas is a separate thing from removing brain damage: you can get restored to full brain operativity,
// but keep the quirks, until repaired by neurine, surgery, lobotomy or magic; depending on the resilience
// of the trauma.
