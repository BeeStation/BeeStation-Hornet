/*
 *	[What does this do?]
 * 		It supports to make adjustment for each map
 *
 * 	[Why don't you just make this with map json file?]
 * 		Some stuff is easy to mistake.
 * 		Being a part of DM files can make a failsafe.
 *
 * 		For example, let's say "Paramedic" is removed from the game.
 * 		But json file will still keep it.
 * 		Or let's say you mistype Pamadic
 * 		Using job defines will be safe
 *
 * 	[I want to add a map adjustment for a map]
 * 		There is a live sample with 'EchoStation'
