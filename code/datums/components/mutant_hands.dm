/**
 * ## Mutant hands component
 *
 * This component applies to humans, and forces them to hold
 * a certain typepath item in every hand no matter what*.
 *
 * For example, zombies being forced to hold "zombie claws" - disallowing them from holding items
 * but giving them powerful weapons to infect people
 *
 * It is suggested that the item path supplied has NODROP (and likely DROPDEL),
 * but nothing's preventing you from not having that.
 *
 * If they lose or gain hands, new mutant hands will be created immediately.
 *
 * Does not override nodrop items that already exist in hand slots.
 * However if those nodrop items are lost, will immediately create a new mutant hand.
