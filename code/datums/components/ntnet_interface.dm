 * Helper function that does 90% of the work in sending a packet
 *
 * This function gets the component and builds a packet so the sending
 * person doesn't have to lift a finger.  Just create a netdata datum or even
 * just a list and it will send it on its merry way.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * * packet_data - Either a list() or a /datum/netdata.  If its netdata, the other args are ignored
 * * target_id - 	Target hardware id or network_id for this packet. If we are a network id, then its
					broadcasted to that network.
 * * passkey - 	Authentication for the packet.  If the target doesn't authenticate the packet is dropped

 * component only handles getting you on the network while SSnetwork and datum/ntnet does all the real work.
 * There are quite a few stack_traces in here.  This is because error checking should be done before this component is
 * added.  Also, there never should be a component that has no network.  If it needs a network assign it to LIMBO
