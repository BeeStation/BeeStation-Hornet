This component makes it possible to make things edible. What this means is that you can take a bite or force someone to take a bite (in the case of items).
These items take a specific time to eat, and can do most of the things our original food items could.

Behavior that's still missing from this component that original food items had that should either be put into seperate components or somewhere else:
	Components:
	Drying component (jerky etc)
	Customizable component (custom pizzas etc)
	Processable component (Slicing and cooking behavior essentialy, making it go from item A to B when conditions are met.)
	Dunkable component (Dunking things into reagent containers to absorb a specific amount of reagents)

	Misc:
	Something for cakes (You can store things inside)
