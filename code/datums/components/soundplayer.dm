	Usage :
		target.AddComponent(/datum/component/sound_player, args)
	Arguments :
		custom_volume : Used to define a custom volume. Default : 30
		custom_sounds : Used to define a list of custom sounds that will be picked at random when play_sound() is triggered. Default : list('sound/items/bikehorn.ogg')
		amount : Used to define an amount of time the component will work before deleting itself. Default : -1
		signal_or_sig_list : Used to register the signal(s) you want to play the sound when they are sent. Default : None
