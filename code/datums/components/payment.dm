/**
  * Handles simple payment operations where the cost of the object in question doesn't change.
  *
  * What this is useful for:
  * Basic forms of vending.
  * Objects that can drain the owner's money linearly.
  * What this is not useful for:
  * Things where the seller may want to fluxuate the price of the object.
  * Improving standardizing every form of payment handing, as some custom handling is specific to that object.
