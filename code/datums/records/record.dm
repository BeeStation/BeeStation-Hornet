 * intended to be used by records that used to try to access `fields["photo_front"]` or
 * `fields["photo_side"]`, and will return an empty icon if there isn't any of the necessary
 * fields.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * * field_name - The name of the key in the `fields` list, of the record itself.
 * * orientation - The direction in which you want the character appearance to be rotated
 * in the outputed photo.
 *
 * Returns an empty `/icon` if there was no `character_appearance` entry in the `fields` list,
 * returns the generated/cached photo otherwise.
