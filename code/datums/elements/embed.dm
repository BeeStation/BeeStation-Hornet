/*
	The presence of this element allows an item (or a projectile carrying an item) to embed itself in a carbon when it is thrown into a target (whether by hand, gun, or explosive wave) with either
	at least 4 throwspeed (EMBED_THROWSPEED_THRESHOLD) or ignore_throwspeed_threshold set to TRUE. Items meant to be used as shrapnel for projectiles should have ignore_throwspeed_threshold set to true.

	Whether we're dealing with a direct /obj/item (throwing a knife at someone) or an /obj/projectile with a shrapnel_type, how we handle things plays out the same, with one extra step separating them.
	Items simply make their COMSIG_MOVABLE_IMPACT_ZONE check, while projectiles check on COMSIG_PROJECTILE_SELF_ON_HIT.
	Upon a projectile hitting a valid target, it spawns whatever type of payload it has defined, then has that try to embed itself in the target on its own.

	Otherwise non-embeddable or stickable items can be made embeddable/stickable through wizard events/sticky tape/admin memes.
