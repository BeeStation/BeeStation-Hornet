	<p>You and your teammate have been chosen by the mothership to go and capture some humans.</p>
	<p>There's two of you: the <b>scientist</b>, who must oversee the camera and surgery, and the <b>agent</b>, who must go down on the station to stun and cuff people.</p>
	<p><img src="scitool.png"/>The scientist must utilize his <b>console</b> and <b>science tool</b>, set to marking mode, to send down the agent, go down himself, mark the target, retrieve it, mark the agent through the console and retrieve him too.</p>
	<p><img src="alienorgan.png"/>After that, he must do the <b>experimentation surgery</b>.</p>
	<p><img src="abaton.png"/>The agent must be sent down by the scientist to stun and cuff a target and drag it into a hidden spot and await the scientist.</p>
	<p>People wearing <b>tinfoil hats</b> are immune to abductor batons.</p>
