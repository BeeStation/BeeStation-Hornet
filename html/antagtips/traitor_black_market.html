	<p>The Black Market has provided you with a disguised uplink. It can either be your PDA, your headset, or your pen.</p>
	<p>The details of your objective are stored within your notes, to see them use the Notes verb.</p>
	<p><img src="pda.png"/>To utilize your <b>PDA</b> uplink, enter the messenger tab and set the ringtone as the code you have been provided.</p>
	<p><img src="headset.png"/>To utilize your <b>Headset</b> uplink, speak the code provided into the :d channel.</p>
	<p><img src="pen.png"/>To utilize the <b>pen</b> uplink, twist it to the first setting, then to the second one.</p>
	<p>The uplink starts out with 20 telecrystals which are utilized to purchase different items to aid you in fulfilling your objectives.</p>
	<p>Try fulfilling your objectives, but don't forget to create fun situations for both you and the crew.</p>
