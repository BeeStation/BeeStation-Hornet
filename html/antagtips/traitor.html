	<p>The syndicate has provided you with a disguised uplink. It can either be your PDA, your headset, your pen or an attachable hand accessory that's currently stored in your bag.</p>
	<p>The details of your objective are stored within your notes, to see them use the Notes verb.</p>
	<p><img src="pda.png"/>To utilize your <b>PDA</b> uplink, enter the messenger tab and set the ringtone as the code you have been provided.</p>
	<p><img src="headset.png"/>To utilize your <b>Headset</b> uplink, change its frequency to the frequency provided.</p>
	<p><img src="pen.png"/>To utilize the <b>pen</b> uplink, twist it to the first setting, then to the second one.</p>
	<p>The uplink starts out with 20 telecrystals which are utilized to purchase different items to aid you in fulfilling your objectives.</p>
	<p>The Syndicate has also given you and any other agents on board code-words which can be used to find eachother. They're highlighted in red and blue.</p>
	<p>Try fulfilling your objectives, but don't forget to create fun situations for both you and the crew.</p>
