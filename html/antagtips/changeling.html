	<p>You are a Changeling, a shapeshifting alien assuming the form of a crewmember on Space Station 13.</p>
	<p><img src="hivemind.png"/>Changelings can anonymously communicate with one another over a <b>hivemind channel</b> by using 'say :g' before their speech.</p>
	<p>The goal of many changelings is to acquire 5-7 DNA strains. To do this, it must take ANY human, living or dead, and acquire their DNA.</p>
	<p><img src="sting_extract.png"/>Use the <b>DNA Extraction Sting</b> and sting a target to stealthily steal their DNA. This will count towards your objective.</p>
	<p><img src="absorb.png"/>Alternatively, you can <b>absorb</b> humans to drain their DNA. Have them in an aggressive grab and click the absorb button on the top left of the screen.</p>
	<p><img src="emporium.gif"/>Use the <b>Cellular Emporium</b> to acquire special abilities which will help you achieve your objectives.</p>
	<p>Absorbing a human will allow you to <b>readapt</b> and purchase different abilities.</p>
	<p><img src="tentacle.png"/>Work together with the other changelings to complete your objectives, but be cautious. Other changelings could have an objective to absorb you.</p>
