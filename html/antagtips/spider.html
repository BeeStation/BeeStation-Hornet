	<h1>You are a Giant Spider!</h1>
	<img src="spider.png"/>
	<p>You are a Giant Spider, an eight-legged insect brought into existence on Space Station 13.</p>
	<p>Spiders can vent crawl to traverse the station. <b>Alt Click</b> a vent to climb into it.</p>
	<p>As a spider, <b>your directives are the most important.</b> If you have a master, follow their orders.</p>
	<p><img src="midwife.png"/><img src="nurse.png"/>Midwife and Nurse spiders are capable of laying eggs and healing other spiders by attacking them. They can eat animals or humans to gain the ability to lay more eggs.</p>
	<p><img src="hunter.png"/><img src="spider.png"/>Guards and Hunters are more capable in combat than egg-laying spiders. Hunters are faster and have venom, whereas Guards are stronger and slower.</p>
	<p><img src="viper.png"/><img src="tarantula.png"/>Eating humans will give egg-laying spiders the ability to lay enriched eggs. These eggs allow you to spawn one Viper, Tarantula, or Broodmother.</p>
	<p>You are strongest in and around webs. Webs block small-arms fire and slow down non-spiders, and some spiders can move more quickly on them.</p>
