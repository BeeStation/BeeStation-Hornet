	<h1>You are a Nuclear Operative!</h1>
	<img src="nukie.png"/>
	<p>The syndicate has provided you with a radio uplink with 30 telecrystals.</p>
	<p><img src="nuke.png"/>You must detonate the nuclear bomb from your ship on Space Station 13. To do that, you must get the nuclear disk.<img src="disk.png"/></p>
	<p>To activate the nuke, you must put in the disk, type in the code, turn off the safety and enable it. You should first unanchor it, move it to the station, re-anchor it and then activate the nuke and take the disk away.</p>
	<p>As a Nuclear Operative, you have different options for purchase such as the Mauler<img src="mech.png"/>or the Energy Shield<img src="eshield.png"/>.</p>
	<p>The leader of the team starts out with a war declaration. If activated, he'll be prompted to write a custom message and declare war.</p>
	<p>Declaring war stops you from going to the station for 20 minutes, alerts the crew and gives you 300 telecrystals.</p>
