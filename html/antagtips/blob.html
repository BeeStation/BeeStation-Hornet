	<h1>You are a Blob!</h1>
	<img src="blobcore.png"/>
	<p>You are the overmind of the blob.</p>
	<p>As the blob, your objective is to reach a critical mass of <b>400 blobs.</b> Shortly, you will be able to place your <b>Blob Core.</b></p>
	<p>Protect your core at all costs. If it is destroyed, you will die and be unable to create any more blobs. Ensure it is placed in an easily defendable or secluded area.</p>
	<p>Check the interface at the bottom of your screen to create special kinds of blobs.</p>
	<p><img src="blobnode.png"/><b>Node blobs</b> slowly expand around them, heal other blobs, and activate blob factories and resource nodes.</p>
	<p><img src="blobresource.png"/>Power is crucial to your success as it allows you to expand outwards. To create more power, place <b>Resource blobs.</b></p>
	<p><img src="blobfactory.png"/>Summon <b>Blob Spores</b> using <b>Factory Blobs.</b> Blob spores attack nearby humans, and transform corpses into <b>Blob Zombies.</b></p>
	<p>Your <b>Blob Strain</b> will have different effects of your attacks. You begin with a free strain reroll, which is regained after a cooldown.</p>
