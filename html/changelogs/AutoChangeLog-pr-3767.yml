changes:
  - code_imp: Replaced extools with auxtools.
  - rscadd: Added Putnam's auxmos, which is like TG's atmos but incredibly performant.
  - rscdel: Removed fastmos, because it's no longer maintained by anybody and it's
      very unstable.
  - code_imp: Atmos is now even more performant than fastmos was.
  - tweak: Firelocks require a crowbar to open/close again.
  - tweak: Firelocks are fulltile again.
