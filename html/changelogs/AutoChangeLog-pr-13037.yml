changes:
  - balance: Morphs can now see living mobs through walls and while vent crawling,
      better enabling them to set up ambushes.
  - balance: Morphs can now initiate a weaker ambush that doesn't inject venom and
      knocks down for less time by attacking mobs while transformed. This type of
      ambush will flash silicons.
  - balance: Successfully ambushing as a morph, or being attacked while disguised
      will now force the morph out of disguise for at least 20 seconds
  - balance: Morph venom now causes worse confusion in mobs affected by the venom
  - tweak: Morphs can no longer carry humanoid mobs and will instead digest them on
      the spot which is interruptible and takes three seconds. Morphs also no longer
      remove clothing items from humanoids they digest, meaning your suit sensors
      can still locate you.
  - tweak: Ambushes now set the morph on a melee attack cooldown while also stunning
      their target for 1 second, giving victims a brief window to understand they
      have been ambushed before beginning to take damage.
  - tweak: Morphs now do burn damage instead of brute (to represent acidic attacks),
      but the damage dealt is unchanged. This makes the damage they deal to cyborgs
      harder to repair, and also makes them much more threatening to IPCs who are
      immune to the venom effects.
  - tweak: "Morph movespeed has been reversed: They are now slow when transformed\
      \ and faster when they aren't. This means they are easier to hit when disguised\
      \ (potentially as something very small), but able to properly pursue targets\
      \ when they aren't."
  - tweak: Morphs now heal from anything they can digest, though the healing is limited
      to 50% of their max HP every 2.5 minutes. Eating mobs bypasses this limitation
      on healing.
  - tweak: Morphs are no longer given away by examining suspicious objects, but attacking
      one will break their disguise and prevent them from taking a new one for 20
      seconds. If you have reason to suspect something is a morph, start swinging
      before you get ambushed.
  - rscadd: Morphs now have a status effect to indicate when they are unable to transform
      and for how long
  - tweak: Morphs no longer have a cooldown on disguises except as described above
      in combat oriented situations.
