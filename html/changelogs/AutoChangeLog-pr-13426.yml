changes:
  - tweak: You can now print clown cars at a mechfab as part of the clown technology
      research node. They take bananium, plastic and iron. This version of the clown
      car can be controlled by anyone inside making it pretty difficult to actually
      go anywhere with an unwilling passenger.
  - rscadd: Added a new subtype of the clown car which is now purchasable from uplinks
      instead of the base version. The uplink version is only controllable by clowns
      and also innately comes with the the toys that used to require emagging a clown
      car to unlock.
  - tweak: Emagging either clown car enables waddling motion with the car, and if
      it was a printed clown car emagging will also lock the controls so that only
      the clown can steer.
  - tweak: Being in combat mode will prevent the printable clown car from kidnapping
      you unless it has been emagged.
