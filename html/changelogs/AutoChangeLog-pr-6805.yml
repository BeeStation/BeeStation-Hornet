changes:
  - balance: Crusher hierophant trophy is now a homing projectile that can hit multiple
      times instead of a cheesy wall that turns our mob AI into window-licking morons.
  - tweak: 'Colossus now telegraphs its attacks three seconds in advance by shouting
      one of five phrases: Judgment (Spiral or Double Spiral), Wrath (Ring), Retribution
      (Shotgun) and Lament (Alternating 4).'
