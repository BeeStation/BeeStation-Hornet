  - bugfix: Supply Consoles and Express Supply Consoles will once again be built pre-emagged
      if their boards used to build them are emagged.
  - bugfix: Supply Consoles will now once again allow Cargonia to buy contraband when
      their circuit boards are appropriately configured with a multitool.
