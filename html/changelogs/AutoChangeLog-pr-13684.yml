changes:
  - tweak: When an APC loses its powernet connection connection, department lights
      will switch to emergency mode almost immediately to conserve power to be spent
      on keeping the area operational for longer.
  - tweak: An APC without an active connection will now continue to power departmental
      equipment until it reaches 15% charge, instead of shutting off vital machinery
      at 50% charge.
  - tweak: APCs now hold 50% more maximum charge at roundstart, and start with 100%
      charge instead of 90%.
