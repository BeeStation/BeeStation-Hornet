changes:
  - bugfix: Fixed "Show All" tab in player panel logs being broken.
  - bugfix: Whispers, OOC, and various other things display differently in logs, visually
      distinguishing them from say logs.
  - refactor: Player panel logs will now show all logs chronologically, so you'll
      see commingled say and attack logs if you're on the "Show All" tab, etc...
