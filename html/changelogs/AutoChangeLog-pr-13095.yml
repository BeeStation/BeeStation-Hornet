changes:
  - rscadd: Added a few new hallucinations. Find them all, but don't lose your head!
  - refactor: Refactored most existing hallucinations. Let me know if any of them
      are acting funky.
  - refactor: RDS quirk is now a brain trauma. The hallucinations brain trauma can
      now be paused with Mindbreaker, like RDS.
  - refactor: Refactored hallucination into a status effect. This means cyborgs and
      simplemobs can (hypothetically) hallucinate now. In most cases they shouldn't
      though.
  - refactor: Refactored fake hud into a status effect.
  - bugfix: Fixes some hallucinations acting improperly. There were multiple cases
      of hallucinations using incorrect icon states which made them completely un-noticable.
  - admin: You can now force specific mass hallucinations.
  - admin: You can now force specific outcomes of some hallucinations, such as delusions,
      fake alerts, fake sounds, and more. Check the VV dropdown.
