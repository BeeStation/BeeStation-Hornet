changes:
  - rscadd: parries. start walking (hold ALT on hotkey mode) to parry attacks you
      block for 0.5 seconds. this makes you not take stamina damage from blocking
      and makes you automatically hit an attack against the attacker. No matter what
      you parry with, the riposte will be done with the item in the active hand, unless
      the active hand is empty. Parrying ignores restrictions on active blocking.
  - tweak: beestation is now the dark souls of ss13
  - soundadd: parry sound, big thanks to GizkaFreeman
