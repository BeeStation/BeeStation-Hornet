changes:
  - rscadd: New craftable a7.62, shotgun, 9mm, 10mm, .38, and .357 ammo types. Lever
      action rifle, craftable pipe rifle and pipe pistol, craftable pipe SMG and magazines.
  - rscadd: Two-step bolt guns (Sniper & Mosin) can have ammo directly chambered,
      allowing loading a single shot without a magazine.
  - rscadd: Pump-action guns can be half-cocked, locking them open to allow directly
      chambering rounds as well.
  - rscadd: Hacksaws are now available from hacked autolathes, very slow manual saw
      for surgery and cutting down guns. The Russian Smuggler hunter shuttle spawns
      with one as well.
  - soundadd: Sawing noise for use with new hacksaw item. Original sound by larryblag
      on freesound.org
  - imageadd: Sprites for new ammo types, guns and accessories. Custom in-hand sprites
      for improv shotgun and pipe rifle. Original lever action shotgun sprite made
      by OceanFish1.
  - balance: Improvised shotguns have an incremental chance to explode when firing
      high-power ammo (buckshot, slugs, most tech shells). No danger with improv ammo
      and all other ammo types (incen, dart, rubbershot, beanbag, improv, breacher,
      dragonsbreath).
  - balance: The Sniper Rifle now uses the same bolt type as the Mosin Nagant. Fire
      rate is marginally slower as a result, and requires two interactions to cycle
      a new cartridge.
  - balance: Sawing adds 1 recoil instead of setting recoil to 1. Sawn-off shotguns
      have higher recoil across the board as a result. Slightly lowers Improv shotgun's
      base recoil as it would be absurd otherwise.
  - balance: The derringer has weapon weight 0.5 instead of 1, and no longer has hard-defined
      unwielded spread to bring it in line with the changes from high speed gun accuracy
  - balance: Improvised guns no longer require firing pins, and longer give free ammo
      when crafted.
  - balance: Improvised shotgun shells have better minimum range.
  - balance: All ammo boxes and external magazines are size SMALL instead of size
      TINY now. Magazines now load 1 bullet at a time, and no longer vacuum up bullets.
  - tweak: Due to rising safety concerns, guns are no longer shipped with a chambered
      round, and must be manually cycled before use.
  - tweak: Improvised weapons require an igniter, and a welder to construct now.
  - tweak: The admin-only trait "NICE_SHOT" now allows the user to cycle PUMP and
      TWO_STEP bolt firearms with a single hand, instead of requiring both.
  - refactor: Changes mosin/boltaction rifle code to be a new bolt type instead of
      bespoke code for the rifle parent type.
