changes:
  - rscadd: adds per-slot examination of carbon clothing. Un-obscured items can be
      examined by hrefs appended to them.  Follows obscuration rules.
  - rscadd: adds visible_message when a mob examines another mob or their clothing,
      ghosts and the like not included, obviously.
  - rscadd: adds police badge fluff. Use it inhand(z) to assign your name and job
      to it, hit people with it to show how important you are.
  - server: adds examination preferences. Examine messages can be turned off like
      paychecks (this doesnt affect other people seeing it), adds preference that
      lets you change how you see links while examining. Either an appended [?] or
      the full item is highlighted. Go to Game > Chat > IC > Advanced preferences
      to change
