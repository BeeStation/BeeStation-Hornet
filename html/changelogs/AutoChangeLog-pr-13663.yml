changes:
  - balance: Buffs tasers, making them easier to aim, giving them longer range while
      you are moving, and decreasing the number of things that can fully block the
      taser.
  - balance: Once the taser lands, you can no longer walk away from it without attacking
      the firer or breaking line of sight with the firer.
  - balance: Removes full pierce protection from all civilian modsuits, including
      security modsuits. Standard pierce protection is applied when they have a melee
      or bullet armour of at least 20.
