changes:
  - rscadd: adds smooth movement
  - rscadd: smooth movement is the clean gliding of items, mobs, or structures across
      turfs. This will apply to you moving around the station, as well as items. Its
      implementation will be most noticeable in zero gravity.
  - bugfix: fixes infinite duplication bug regarding space movement of items and "phantom
      pickups"
  - config: updates default server to 60 fps, from 20 fps
  - tweak: defaults camera acceleration to FALSE. If you are playing an eyeobj mob
      like a camera console, AI, or blob overmind and it looks really bad, turn off
      your camera acceleration. CamE looks terrible on my high-end pc, but fine on
      my laptop, so user experience may vary.
