changes:
  - tweak: RPD subcategories and preview icons reorganized.
  - rscadd: RPD now starts with painting turned off, hitting pipes with build and
      no paint will target the turf underneath instead. Bye bye turf pixelhunting.
  - rscadd: Reverse wrench mode upgrade to the RPD. Attention, due to budget cuts,
      the mode is hard linked to the destroy mode control button.
  - rscadd: You can now change piping layers on the RPD by scrolling with the mouse
      wheel.
  - bugfix: Various cumulative fixes to RPDs
  - rscadd: RPD can destroy broken disposal pipe
  - balance: Securing a disposal pipe over a floor tile with a crowbar in your offhand
      will remove the floor tile before trying to secure it
