changes:
  - balance: replaced ninja's teleport with a dash similar to syndicate experimental
      teleporter's, but instead of telefrag, it automatically attacks every mob encountered
      with the sword, unless on help intent
  - balance: energy katana damage nerfed from 40 to 25
  - balance: ninja dash charges no longer recharge in parallel, now recharging one
      at a time
  - balance: ninja dash can now be stopped by a functional bluespace anchor
  - bugfix: fixed runtimes causing loss of functionality or of visual effects with
      energy katana dash
  - bugfix: ninja suit examine now properly shows related stats when initialized
  - refactor: extracted the logic in syndicate experimental teleporter's attempt_teleport
      into a generalized and parametrizable do_dash proc
  - code_imp: rewrote syndicate experimental teleporter and ninja dash to use the
      new do_dash proc
