changes:
  - balance: removed all genetic printlines, you can't *feel* Swedish anymore. You
      better trust that the Genetics Expert gave you something good.
  - balance: removed most genetic stability messages, except for the penultimate and
      final meltdown one.
  - spellcheck: Made some mutations descriptions more consistent and immersive. Cleared
      up terminology misuse.
