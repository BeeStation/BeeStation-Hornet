changes:
  - bugfix: Latejoin now shows Head of Personnel job to Civilian and Cargo categories
      both along with Command category.
  - bugfix: When HoP job is in a non-command category, it showed the category as Command.
      (i.e. Supply as Command) now they're consistently showing proper categories
      even if HoP is there.
