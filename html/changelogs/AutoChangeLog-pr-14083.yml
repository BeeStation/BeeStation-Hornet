changes:
  - bugfix: Fixed megafauna legion sprite offset being wrong.
  - bugfix: Fixed megafauna legion going invisible.
  - bugfix: Fixed megafauna legion splitting into 3 instead of 2 in rare cases.
  - balance: The mentioned invisibility fix also means that the Legion will have slightly
      more health than before upon splitting but only in the cases where it gets overkilled.
