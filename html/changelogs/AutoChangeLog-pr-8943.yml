changes:
  - code_imp: Updated some TGUI dependencies.
  - tweak: TGUI now supports DPI scaling, provided you use a BYOND version modified
      to use a modern browser.
  - tweak: TGUI LabeledLists should now wrap text by default instead of overflowing.
  - bugfix: TGUI Number inputs modals now accept negative numbers.
  - bugfix: TGUI Number inputs modals can now accept decimals and not round them.
  - tweak: Tabs can now have customized colors. They should also function better inside
      Section boxes, and have better padding and margins.
  - tweak: Arrow keys are grabbed by TGUI for keyboard navigation, won't move your
      character unless you have hotkeys off.
  - tweak: Improved TGUI's handling of static data on refresh, now a Loading prompt
      will be shown while static data is on cooldown instead of just straight up not
      sending it.
  - tweak: Multiline TGUI inputs now support line breaks, accessible via shift-enter!
      A maximum of two consecutive line breaks is allowed, any more than that will
      be automatically stripped. This only applies to input boxes that start with
      the multiline view enabled, and will thus not work on input boxes that aren't
      meant to support it.
