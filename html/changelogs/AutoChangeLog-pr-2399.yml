changes:
  - tweak: piercing syringes now inject past thick clothing when not shot from a syringe
      gun as well
  - balance: syringe guns no longer instantly inject their reagents, instead injecting
      them over time
  - rscadd: syringes can be embedded on harm intent, also injecting reagents over
      time, but at a slower rate
  - bugfix: explosive chem mixes no longer purge chems if an explosion is not triggered
