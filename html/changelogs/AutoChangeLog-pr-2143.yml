delete-after: true
changes:
  - rscadd: Wings are now organs!  they can be surgically removed and attached, allowing
      doctors to create even more hideous abominations!
  - rscadd: cybernetic wings, unlocked in shuttle technodes. A normal version, equivalent
      to normal wings, and an alien version that works without atmosphere exist
  - tweak: flight potion now works on all races, and no longer removes the backpack
      slot. if the imbiber has wings already, their wings will be upgraded instead,
      and keep their original look
  - balance: apid wings now work like moth wings, instead of having a special dash
      that has combat utility, and their downside has been reduced to 1.5X burn damage,
      and keeping their flyswatter and pest spray penalties
  - bugfix: apids can open and close their wings again. the *wing emote can be used
      to toggle them, and the *flap and *aflap emotes make them flap
  - code_imp: makes flight code less shtity and snowflaky
  - imageadd: moth wing sprites by azlanonpc
  - imageadd: shitty apid wing codersprites by zesko
  - imageadd: cybernetic wings by thatguythere03
