changes:
  - tweak: Stargazer slime links now link to one's mind rather than body, meaning
      the link comes with you should you mind swap or something. Do note the link
      still breaks if you die.
  - rscadd: 'Added a saymode for slime links: ".j Hello, slime link!"'
  - tweak: Stargazer slime links and telepathy now use tgui input rather than BYOND
      input.
  - rscadd: Stargazers can now manually unlink people from their slime link!
