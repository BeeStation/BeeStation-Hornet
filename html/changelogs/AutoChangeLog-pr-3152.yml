changes:
  - balance: Buckshot - Reduced raw damage from 12.5 to 9. Decreased spread from 25
      to 10 degrees.
  - balance: 'Soporific - First shot now applies 8 seconds of confusion. If hitting
      a confused target, will put them to sleep for 5 seconds (Old effect: 5 seconds
      sleep).'
  - balance: Meteor Slug - Hard stun reduced from 8 seconds to 2 seconds. Stun is
      applied if the target hits a wall due to knockback of the shell.
  - balance: Frag12 - 5 seconds of paralysis reduced to 1 second. Not that it really
      matters since these are generally going to be a 1 hit kill from the explosion
      or at least limbs will be lost.
  - balance: Rubbershot - Reduced stamina damage from 11 to 9. Reduced variance from
      25 to 20
  - balance: Incapacitating Shell - Reduced variance from 25 to 20, stamina damaged
      reduced from 6 to 5
  - balance: Laser Slug - Reduced damage from 15 to 10. (This thing was ridiculous
      before and actually pretty easy to make)
  - balance: Shotguns - Pump-action shotguns now require the pumping hand to be empty.
  - balance: Mech Scattershot - Pellet damage reduced from 24 to 18.
  - balance: Slugs now have an armour penetration of -60, making them very effective
      against unarmoured targets but not armoured targets.
