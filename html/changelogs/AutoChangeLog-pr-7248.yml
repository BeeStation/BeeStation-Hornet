changes:
  - bugfix: Nightmares can no longer accidentally space themselves while jaunted.
      Rematerializing manually will allow entry into space, which is bright enough
      to harm and prevent further jaunting
  - tweak: Nightmares are no longer exposed or harmed when adjacent to space tiles
  - tweak: Nightmares can no longer enter solid tiles which are bright enough to force
      rematerialization
  - rscadd: Light eater can now force doors open, even if they are powered (But not
      if bolted or welded)
  - balance: Nightmares are less capable of entering well-lit areas, but are even
      more slippery than before now that they can reliably re-enter the station from
      space if they're fast enough and can afford the harm it causes. Nightmares should
      be almost incapable of killing themselves via lag or accidental mishaps as well
      now.
  - code_imp: Due to code shuffling of door prying, changeling armblades now require
      non-harm intent to open doors.
