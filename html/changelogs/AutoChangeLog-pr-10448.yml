  - rscadd: Footprints and bloody shoes major update. Hardsuits and bare feet can
      now get bloody as well. Improved blood spreading behaviour.
  - bugfix: Shoes will no longer get bloody while wearing something that covers them.
  - tweak: Blood splatters only make your shoes or feet bloody if the tile is bloody
      enough,
  - tweak: Light steps trait prevents clothing from being covered in blood if you
      step on a bloody tile with your shoes off.
  - rscadd: Blood dries over time. Usually, 3 or 6 minutes. If a splatter is big enough,
      it can stay wet up to 15 minutes.

      data for scans and should no longer print out blank entries erroneously.
