changes:
  - refactor: Refactors minebot code.
  - rscadd: Minebots can now autonomously mine when set to mining mode. However, they
      won't avoid obstacles such as lava while this is active, so you should still
      keep an eye on them.
  - rscadd: Minebots aren't gibbed on death, and can be revived with a welder.
  - tweak: Removing ore from a minebot is now done by alt-clicking the minebot.
  - rscadd: Adds a weatherproofing module, an automatic ore pickup module, and a medipen
      module for minebots.
  - balance: The minebot AI upgrade doesn't nerf a minebot's stats anymore, however
      some upgrades have been changed to compensate for this.
  - balance: Minebots can now equip additional equipment such as plasma cutters, advanced
      drills, and mining scanners. These can be attached to a minebot by using them
      on said minebot.
