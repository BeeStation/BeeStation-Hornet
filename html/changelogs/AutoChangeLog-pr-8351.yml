changes:
  - rscadd: 'All drug addictions are now put into 5 categories: Stimulants, Opioids,
      Alcohol, Hallucinogens, and Maintenance Drugs. All narcotics have been given
      a category corresponding to their effect.'
  - bugfix: Narcotics that had clearly addicting effects, yet were missing an addiction
      call, now properly interface with the new addiction system.
  - rscadd: new stats have been added to some chemistry reagents that will help medical
      deal with these new effects. Neurine and Sodium-Thiopetal can be used to alleviate
      seizures from drug abuse.
  - tweak: Completely gutted the "threshold" addiction system in favor of a point
      based system. It progresses much like disease tiers. Addiction is no longer
      some joke noobtrap that just affects your mood, if you partake in a shitton
      of drugs, you will feel the consequences.
