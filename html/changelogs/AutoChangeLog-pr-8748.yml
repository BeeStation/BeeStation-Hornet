changes:
  - rscadd: Food storage! Hide some glass in the captains cake! Fuck his digestive
      system!!! (Not really, accidental consumption isnt active w/o wounds or stomach
      refactor, so It doesnt do anything yet lmao)
  - rscadd: Bread, Cake and Spaghetti to Newfood
  - rscadd: dunkable element. Dunk yo nuggies in the ketchup.
  - rscadd: some smaller foods can now be eaten whilst on the run! (This ONLY applies
      to newfood items thus far!)
  - rscadd: converted edible component to work with newfood
  - rscdel: oldfood for Bread, Cake and Spaghetti
  - tweak: edited a few messed up values
  - tweak: food trash is sensible now. Finishing stuff like cake will actually spawn
      a plate rubbish. Instead of you eating the plate, fatso, perhaps properly dispose
      of it!
  - bugfix: Wildly STUPID item weights. Candycorn and cakes are no longer the SAME
      size
