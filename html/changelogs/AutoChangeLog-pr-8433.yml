changes:
  - tweak: having monitoring nanites can make you trackable by pinpointer. simple/carbon
      mobs with monitoring nanites are now trackable by pinpointer (as long as they
      have mind...) Jammer will disable this.
  - rscadd: pinpointer is now trackable z-levels as long as those z-levels are in
      the same group (i.e. multi-floored station). Orange bar will appear if your
      target is within the same type z-level.
  - imageadd: some pinpointer indicating sprites
  - refactor: better pinpointer code
