changes:
  - tweak: Supermatter delaminations now scale with how long the crystal has been
      powered. This means if someone who is still learning messes up during the initial
      setup, the explosion will be much smaller than if the engine has been running
      for a while before it went south.
  - tweak: Supermatter crystal explosions will reach their previous maximum force
      after being powered for 45 minutes, but they will continue to grow after this
      point meaning they are only capped in power by the duration of the round.
  - tweak: Tesla and Singularity delaminations have scaling requirements as well,
      but these values plateau to their old requirements after the supermatter has
      been powered for 45 minutes.
