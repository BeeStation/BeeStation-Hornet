changes:
  - admin: Admin verbs and tabs have been moved and reorganized all around. You should
      find each tab to be more intuitive and less cluttered with unrelated verbs.
  - admin: The "Ticket Manager" verb now works. It's... Identical to the "Open Ticket
      Browser" verb.
  - admin: An old and mostly unknown admin verb now features logging.
  - admin: You can now edit team objectives from the team panel. No more removing
      and adding!
