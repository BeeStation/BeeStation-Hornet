changes:
  - tweak: Hierophant and Colossus no longer dust their victims, instead gibbing them
      so that there is hope for recovery.
  - tweak: All miners falling to any megafauna now drop all their items (notably their
      GPS) before being gibbed to improve their chances of being found and recovered
      by others.
