changes:
  - balance: Adjusted spider stats with a focus on reducing their ability to snowball
      through sheer numbers and increasing their reliance on venom instead of brute
      force.
  - balance: Spiders are now immune to the vacuum and cold of space.
  - tweak: Broodmothers can no longer heal, but have more venom, damage and health
  - tweak: Nurses can no longer reproduce, but have slightly more health
  - tweak: Guards are now the slow tanky choice instead of tarantulas.
  - bugfix: fixed an exploit with spider egg clusters and enriched spawns
  - rscdel: Spiders are no longer available for science department traitors.
