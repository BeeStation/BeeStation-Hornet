delete-after: true
changes:
  - rscadd: beware of the clown with a piano (falling objects now deal damage and
      pianos crush people)
  - rscadd: Pianos now have a broken sprite (this was always in the game, but unused)
  - soundadd: Pianos have a sound for being hit now
  - tweak: Pianos are no longer randomly a minimoog on spawn, there is now a mapping
      helper for that now
