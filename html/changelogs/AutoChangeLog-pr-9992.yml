changes:
  - refactor: movespeed modifiers are now datums and not lists and support global
      caching.
  - server: global caching of movespeed modifiers should both save on performance
      for modifiers that constantly change (sepia stabilized extract)
  - bugfix: ignore_slowdown works correctly
