changes:
  - bugfix: Fixed nooartrium working in mobs it wasn't supposed to
  - tweak: Nooartrium now causes the affected mob to make a loud zombie wail when
      initially taking the drug, zombie growl periodically while the drug is active,
      and wail again (different, weaker one) when the drug's effects end.
  - tweak: Nooartrium now causes at least 25 heart damage when metabolization ends
      to give it a flavorful downside as a purely medical revival drug.
  - tweak: Nooartrium now only requires heating to 470K, just under teslium's activation
      point at 474.
  - code_imp: Cleaned up a lot of nooartrium code while trying to preserve all of
      the original balance aside from the above points regarding revival and sounds.
