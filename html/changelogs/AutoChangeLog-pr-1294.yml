changes: 
  - balance: "Tend Wounds is now only 2 steps (Scalpel > healing with Hemostat. Cautery when done)"
  - bugfix: "Borgs can now perform Tend Wounds"
  - rscadd: "Anti-spam on Tend Wounds (Starting Message only, Result Message untouched)"
  - rscadd: "Keep their pants on! Now Tend Wounds can be done through clothing! However it is 60% less efficient this way"
  - tweak: "You can upgrade both Tend Wounds Burn/Brute trees via techwebs"
  - rscadd: "Advancing far enough into the tree enables Mixed Tend Wounds surgery, which heals less of each but is considerably faster. Get alien tech for the best of the best!"
  - balance: "TW fail chance when using improvised tools decreased. Hooray for ghetto surgery!"
  - balance: "Medibot no longer works off chems and instead performs a lesser equivalent to Tend wounds"
  - balance: "They still heal all 4 base damages and use same clothing restrictions as previously"
  - rscdel: "Medibot Beaker Holding / Virus Treating no longer exists"
  - rscadd: "Medibots scale with Tend Wound research (1 tend wound surgery researched = 50% more healing)"
  - rscadd: "Medibots heal more of a specific damage if the medkit used to make them was oriented around that damage (a tox medkit medibot will heal toxin better)"
  - tweak: "Emagged Medibots now pretend to tend your wounds, actually damaging you and applying 5u chloral per step."
  - rscadd: "Surgery steps are now shown in detail only to the surgeon and anyone standing adjacent to them; the patient and people watching from further away get a more vague/ambiguous description."
  - rscadd: "Operating computers can now be built to sync with all nearby stasis beds within it's LoS and provide them with advanced surgeries."
  - balance: "Failing TW now give 80% damage (based off normal healing) instead of flat 5 brute"
  - rscadd: "Tend Wounds now scales with missing health!"
  - tweak: "All Tend Wound Upgrades (bar Alien Tech Combo Surgery) do same base healing but scale with missing health differently. They should all heal more than they usually do in most cases though."
  - code_imp: "Medibots were NOT changed and will continue to NOT scale with missing HP to make humans more desired."
  - rscadd: "Operation tables and stasis beds now link to operation computer when built"
