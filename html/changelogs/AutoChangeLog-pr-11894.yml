changes:
  - refactor: refactored storage component to be datumized
  - tweak: tweaked overall weight of items so all the outfits fit again. TELL ME IF
      IT IS A SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE FROM BEFORE, it should be about the same. Most
      of them were relating to ERT.
  - balance: increased the slots of ERT/Abductor bags because trying to fit all those
      items that featurecoders like to put in them was causing errors during outfit
      init.
  - balance: tweaks trashbag interaction to remove cheese, but keep balance in new
      system
  - tweak: decreased storage notification spam for ore bags
  - rscadd: adds storage mass transferring to griddles
