changes:
  - rscadd: Added a radial menu to the skin selection of Detective's revolver, Bartender's
      double barrel shotgun, Captain's fountain pen and Chaplain's Bible.
  - tweak: If a bible has been reskinned, all other bibles will get reskinned to the
      same appearance when attempting to reskin them
  - rscadd: Allowed blind Chaplains to reskin their bibles.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that would make the skin selection prompt to appear for a
      second time when you cancelled it for the double barrel shotgun
  - refactor: Refactored the reskin_obj code to use a radial menu instead of outputting
      the choices to the chat
