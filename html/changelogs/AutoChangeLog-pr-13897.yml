changes:
  - balance: Examine in detail now only shows mostly static information about objects
      worn by other people, preventing you from accidentally meta-gaming items which
      are meant to be hidden. You can still inspect armour values of items worn by
      other people.
  - rscadd: Adds a system so that when someone inspects the armour values of an item,
      it shows faked numbers if it is mimicking another item.
  - bugfix: Fixes value traits not working.
