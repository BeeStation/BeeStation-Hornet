changes:
  - tweak: Mutation tox now has a minute window where you can purge the chem to avoid
      being changed (It functions EXACTLY like old slime mutation toxin)
  - tweak: Slime Mutation Toxin is replaced by Mutation Toxin since they now function
      100% the same. Think of this as just a name change!
