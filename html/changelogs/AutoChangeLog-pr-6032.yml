changes:
  - refactor: Change to the cloning console and machine codes for error returns
  - bugfix: Cloning console TG window is now automatically updated when you trigger
      something.
  - tweak: Cloning console now tells which error you have failed to clone at.
  - tweak: Cloning console now properly lets you know that you can't clone a presaved
      person. It has always been so, but it has not warned you.
  - bugfix: Cloning record id is now reliably saved based on your name and mind, which
      fixes the record conflicts.
  - bugfix: Cloning console displays and accepts data in cloning diskettes properly,
      but remember that the clonable data becomes outdated once you clone them.
  - bugfix: Cloning console now can track the presaved person's health status.
  - tweak: Players can't turn on the autoclone manually anymore. admin still can turn
      it on by variable edit. (Note that Autoclone has not ever been working, ever.)
  - tweak: Body only clone will not transfer your quirks anymore and transferring
      your brain into that body will make you lose them. This is likely a bug due
      to the structure of quirks. Full scan clone still keeps them, so the brain transplant
      trick will not work.
  - bugfix: Experimental cloner will properly work now and they can save data records
      now.
  - rscadd: Experimental clone ghost role added. It will find candidates to pick rather
      than just allowing all ghosts to come in. (*a clone being catatonic means no
      ghost wanted the role.)
  - bugfix: You're not allowed to scan xenomorphs anymore - they'll not be cloned
      as a human. Don't harass them.
