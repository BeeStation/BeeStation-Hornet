changes:
  - rscadd: Hud is now tracked based on your card appearance. HoP is now supposed
      to repaint crews' card in order to give them correct hud icons, or securities(+ghosts)
      will blame you.
  - rscadd: every card now has default hud icons. (i.e. Captain's Spare card has a
      blank command HUD, budget cards have blank department color HUD)
  - rscadd: added more PDA style options to PDA painter. (deputy, prisoner, heads,
      unassigned, etc)
  - refactor: PDA painter is now easy to recognise colourising style easier.
  - tweak: Some job HUDs are now only available through emaged ID card repainter.
  - tweak: crew monitor now tracks crew job color based on hud state.
  - tweak: Assistant id card crew objective is now greentextable when your card is
      painted even if the job name is still assistant.
  - rscadd: hud image based defines
  - refactor: crew manifest is based on hud state.
  - refactor: PDA painter machine now updates the crew manifest upon ID repainting
  - refactor: changes to chameleon code and agent card, to make Hud icon update working.
      Chameleon agent card has earned QoL. They'll get a default job name of a card
      type you chose once changed.
  - rscadd: agent card will be randomised upon EMP. (random hud icon, random job name,
      random icon)
  - rscadd: broken chameleon agent card (with all wiped access, and unable to copy
      accesses from another card)
  - rscadd: broken chameleon kit will have broken chameleon agent card.
  - rscadd: new hud icons, new card images (blank symbol department color hud icons,
      new hudking icon)
  - rscdel: 9x9 pixel size 'hudking' hud icon
  - rscadd: New card types for the purpose of chameleon agent card. (i.e. "their majesty's
      gold identification card")
  - tweak: Some card types are now blacklisted from chameleon agent card - because
      they don't make sense. (i.e changeling fake ones)
  - tweak: your card paycheck department is now re-assigned based on your hud icon
      state. if your hud icon is red with job name 'not real security', you are paid
      by the security budget. the process happens when you repaint a card or give
      a new job name to a card.
  - tweak: not all gimmicks are in civilian department anymore. Psychiatrist is medical,
      and Stage Magician is service like their mime/clown fellows. (VIP and barber
      are still service)
