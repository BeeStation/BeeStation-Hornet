changes:
  - refactor: Converted everything to use setAnchored() as opposed to setting the
      anchored var directly. This means that COMSIG_MOVABLE_SETANCHORED can now actually
      be used reliably to track if an object's anchored var has changed.
  - bugfix: The refactor also means that varediting the anchored var will now properly
      update most items' other states that rely on it being set a certain way.
  - bugfix: Fixed bookcases having the incorrect icon when they're unanchored.
  - bugfix: Fixed bookcases not automatically picking up spellbooks / storage books
      when made/spawned.
  - bugfix: Fixed bookcases not dropping spellbooks / storage books when deconstructed.
