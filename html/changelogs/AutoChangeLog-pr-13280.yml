changes:
  - rscadd: All objects now have an export value
  - rscadd: Added a supply/demand feature to export values
  - tweak: Improved export scanner readings including, readability, demand (aka stock),
      contraband checks and gas price analisys
  - tweak: Added visual and sound effects to the export scanner
  - tweak: Items that aren't sold on the cargo shuttle (either due to being worth
      nothing or because they are blocked from being sold) will stay on the shuttle
      for return instead of being deleted
  - bugfix: Fixed Multiple export errors
  - bugfix: Fixed an exploit that caused any items to be able to be deleted by using
      the cargo shuttle
  - refactor: Removed a lot of export datums in favour of a catchall datum for all
      objects that do NOT fit other export datums
  - balance: Reduced starting cargo budget to 2000 credits, because of this all other
      department cards got 8000 starting cargo budget
  - code_imp: Added a framework for defining standard department budgets
  - code_imp: Some types such as stock_parts and stacks have a calculate_price proc
      that handles custom_price based on different factors (part tier, stack amount,
      for instance)
  - balance: Items now start with a randomized price based on their weight if a custom
      price isn't set
