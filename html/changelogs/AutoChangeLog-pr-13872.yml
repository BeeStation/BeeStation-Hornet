changes:
  - balance: converted beestation's maintenance loot list into a triple-level weighted
      list. Loot is broken up by tiers and categories. The previous loot list was
      considered for its specific parts, but it should not be expected for the new
      maintenance list to be congruent to it.
  - refactor: defines pick_weight_recursive()
  - code_imp: languages can weight syllables. (Fun fact, Galactic Common uses Mandarin
      Chinese syllables)
  - code_imp: adds support for converting armories to use mapping spawners rather
      than manual edits. This PR author would prefer not to step on toes by mass-standardizing
      armories at the moment.
  - admin: Added a config that regulates random spawners weights.
  - bugfix: modsuit maint modules now correctly spawn
  - bugfix: fake nuke disks no longer have the stationloving component, so they dont
      break the atom init anymore
  - rscadd: readds the greytide spear. Its never existed outside of adminspawn, which
      was a contributor to it being removed. It now has a use inside the maint pool.
