changes:
  - balance: Stimulum is toxic again!
  - tweak: Stimulum now causes difficulty breathing and oxyloss instead of plain toxin
      damage, and has new notifications to assist in its usage. Recommended usage
      is huffing one breath of stimulum for a high, and then waiting two minutes for
      it to wear off before huffing again.
