changes:
  - code_imp: Checks for role bans, ghost role toggles and ghost role cooldowns have
      been moved from spawners to client code for easier use in determining ghost
      role eligibility
  - bugfix: Spider eggs, carp portals and other playable mobs now respect role bans,
      ghost role toggles and ghost role cooldowns.
