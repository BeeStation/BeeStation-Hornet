changes:
  - tweak: HE pipes can now cool to within 1 Kelvin of the environment instead of
      20 Kelvin
  - tweak: HE pipes only require a temp difference of 1 degree to exchange heat, down
      from 20. This makes HE pipes viable for cooling/heating station rooms.
  - balance: A knock-on effect of the HE pipe change is that space cooling is much
      more powerful
