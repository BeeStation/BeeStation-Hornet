changes:
  - code_imp: 'minor port of set_eye() and reset_perspective() proc from TG, #PR 69115
      (LemonInTheDark)'
  - code_imp: improved basic game system to track client's currently used eye
  - tweak: advanced camera is now visible by anyone even if it's currently used by
      someone. (This doesn't support the shuttle docking system, because it uses different
      one.)
  - bugfix: minor fix that advanced camera was still usable even if you're locker'ed
