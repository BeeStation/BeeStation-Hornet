changes:
  - tweak: disarm intent cooldown has been reverted
  - tweak: wallshoves immobilize for half the knockdown duration - less crawling around
  - tweak: There is now a very brief stun when disarming a knocked down person again.
      The stun can not be chained back to back consistently.
  - tweak: Tableshoves now produce a stun instead of just a knockdown.
  - balance: Wallshoves are slightly better again.
