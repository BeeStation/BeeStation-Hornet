changes:
  - sounddel: Removes 5 sounds that were ripped from Jojo
  - balance: Healing holoparasite ability potential matters less for healing (3 to
      7 healing instead of 0 to 7.5)
  - balance: Frenzy Holopara - Removed ranged teleport ability
  - balance: Frenzy Holopara - Attack will now teleport you behind the victim
  - balance: Frenzy Holopara - Cooldown for teleport attack reduced from 3 seconds
      to 2 + (0.2 * (0 to 5 depending on potential)) (2 to 3 seconds) (potential actually
      means something now)
  - balance: Frenzy Holopara - The Attack() function of frenzy no longer calls itself
      and therefor no longer bursts the eardrums of the guardian.
  - balance: Frenzy Holopara - Reduces the range of the throw to 2 tiles rather than
      20, which only takes effect if the potential is greater than 3 (B or A).
  - balance: Time Holopara - Renamed to Time Distortion
  - balance: Time Holopara - Cost lowered from 6 to 4
  - balance: Time Holopara - Decoys spawn on guardian attack rather than as an ability
  - balance: Time Holopara - Decoy spawn time changed to 6 seconds
  - balance: Time Holopara - Recharge time changed to 8 to 13 seconds
  - balance: Time Holopara - Removed godmode effect, this now just spawns decoys rather
      than giving immortality for a while
  - balance: Time Holopara - Doppelgangers now fade out slowly (which is just a cool
      effect)
  - balance: Hand Holopara - No longer stuns mobs
