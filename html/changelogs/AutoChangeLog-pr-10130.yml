changes:
  - tweak: Cooking Oil damaging mobs now respects that mobs reagent permeability (i.e.
      clothing BIO damage resistance)
  - tweak: upped the damage output by Cooking Oil a tiny bit to account for average
      crewmembers jumpsuit.
  - refactor: Turned deepfriedholder into an element. Deepfrying stuff is no longer
      ancient code, and is much cleaner.
  - bugfix: Deepfrying respects indestructibility, always.
  - bugfix: Adding reagents to the Deepfryer will no longer display an attack animation
  - bugfix: Adds a check that prevents normally deepfryable/edible items that also
      can store items inside them from being fried. Should stop weird edge-cases where
      consuming said item would qdel indestructible items inside.
  - code_imp: our file with defined colors looks less terrible
