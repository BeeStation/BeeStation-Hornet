changes:
  - bugfix: cleans up gibtonite overlays. The overlay will no longer eat clicks when
      you are trying to defuse it with a mining scanner
  - bugfix: flick_overlay is an atom proc. flick_overlay is also faster
  - bugfix: Taking items from your inventory while flying over lava or a chasm will
      NOT set them on fire or drop them into chasms ANYMORE
