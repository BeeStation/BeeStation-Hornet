changes:
  - code_imp: mech construction refactored
  - rscadd: You can now replace the scanning modules and capacitors on a mech. Just
      use your ID on the mech after opening the panel during maintenance procedures
      to remove the part you want to replace, and then insert the new part afterwards.
  - tweak: Replacing a power cell on a mech no longer uses a screwdriver, and functions
      the same as the replacement steps for scanning modules and capacitors.
  - bugfix: Mechs removed from the game via means other than damage no longer leave
      a wreckage.
