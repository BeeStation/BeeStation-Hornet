changes:
  - rscadd: macrophage disease symptom and corresponding mob
  - rscadd: currently admin only macrophage mob that spawns with a disease inside
      of it which contains the macrophage symptom. Phage has appropriate stats for
      the disease
  - tweak: changes up random experimental diseases a bit codewise, to support random
      spawning diseases with one symptom fixed. This feature has been added to the
      necroseed culture tendril loot, so it's now a bit of a gamble to drink
  - imageadd: macrophage sprites, done by Slyonic
