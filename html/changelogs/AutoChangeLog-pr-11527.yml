changes:
  - code_imp: Removes proc_holders in favour of using /datum/action and expanding
      on it some more
  - refactor: refactors how spell code works making it badass and stuff
  - tweak: Many spells changed to conform with the new code order, included is telepathy
      that now works by providing the user with a list of targets instead of clicking
      on one
  - tweak: Spell cooldowns are very likely to be slightly different (Actually readable)
      Old cooldown code is an unreadable mess
