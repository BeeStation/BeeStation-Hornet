changes:
  - bugfix: Fixes REFRESH-style status effects (goodmusic)
  - code_imp: Updated some status effect tick code to be more clear of how long is
      elapsing between ticks. Should not be overtly noticeable.
  - rscadd: Some alerts, such as Fleshmend's, show their remaining duration on their
      icon.
  - bugfix: fix bad assignments of status effect id's
  - rscadd: adds priority subsystem for important status effects. Important stats
      like stuns are put higher than others, so they should no longer last longer
      than normal due to increased server load.
