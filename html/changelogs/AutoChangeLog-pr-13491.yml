changes:
  - tweak: Lowers the heat capacity of the space mixture, so that heat is sucked out
      of rooms exposed to space more slowly.
  - balance: Firedoors now close when pressure around them is too low/high
  - balance: Air alarms will now attempt to automatically correct temperature issues
      when in their standard operating mode.
  - rscdel: Removes air alarm AC mode
  - balance: Vents now have a heating element and can be used to heat rooms by a small
      amount.
  - balance: Firedoors which activated due to heat/pressure will not open when the
      fire alarm button is pressed.
  - balance: Firedoors will no longer remain open permanently when emagged, they will
      open briefly, will not respond to high temperatures and will open when hit with
      anything.
