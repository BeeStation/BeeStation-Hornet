changes:
  - bugfix: Most martial arts now ignore blocking entirely, with Krav Maga, Boxing
      and Psychotic Brawling being the exceptions that are still blockable. Don't
      fight the chef on his turf.
  - bugfix: Items which block projectiles now correctly report their behavior when
      examined
  - bugfix: Blocked projectiles no longer trigger their on_hit effects. They didn't
      hit after all.
  - bugfix: Stun batons (and subtypes of them) can now be blocked properly. There
      was a major refactor to stun baton code, so please report anything unusual you
      notice.
  - tweak: Stun Batons (and subtypes) can no longer harm baton. They do either stamina
      damage when on, or brute when they are off.
  - tweak: Stun batons (and subtypes) as well as telescopic batons do not deal any
      stamina or shield damage when successfully blocked. They still trigger the block
      cooldown, but you're going to need something stronger to break through a shield.
  - tweak: Teleprods can now be worn on the back and have backsprites
