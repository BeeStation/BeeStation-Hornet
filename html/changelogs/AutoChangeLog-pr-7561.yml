changes:
  - rscadd: compression box of (head items) that contains head outfits (and CE tools
      for CE) to solve the overloading issue of the head lockers. Holding this box
      will slow your movement extremely, so you'll not be able to steal their compressed
      box that easily.
  - tweak: mixed wardrobe has a compression box of its jumpsuits/skirts because it
      has the same issue too.
  - tweak: all heads lockers will have pet collar and pet carrier.
  - tweak: captain's locker now has a megaphone.
  - refactor: changed some head locker items ordering
