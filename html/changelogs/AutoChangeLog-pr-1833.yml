changes:
  - rscadd: Monstermos from yogs, which significantly improves atmos performance.
  - tweak: Firedoors are no longer full-tile. This means you can walk though a pair
      of firedoors without depressurizing a room.
  - tweak: Space wind is faster and deadlier.
  - tweak: Windows are significantly stronger, with most having 4x as much health.
  - tweak: Windows bordering space now have firelock windows to seal breaches.
  - tweak: You can automatically walk through a closed firedoor if doing so isn't
      likely to kill you.
  - tweak: Did I mention atmos is faster? It's way faster. Gas will quickly flood
      a room.
  - server: Improved linux support for extools. This means nothing for players, but
      might be useful for downstream server owners. Some of the code was created by
      SpaceManiac.
  - tweak: Air alarms will turn the lights blue in areas with hazardous atmos.
  - tweak: Lavaland atmos has a higher minimum pressure.
  - rscadd: Cycling airlocks that don't suck. Ported from Yogs.
  - rscadd: Players can now easily construct cycling airlocks.
  - tweak: To make repressurizing airlocks faster, the default distro pressure has
      been increased to 500 kPa. Atmos Techs can increase repressurization speed further.
  - tweak: Lavaland scrubbers will scrub BZ and other harmful gasses by default.
  - tweak: Mechs can open firelocks in some cases. Credit to MacHac at yogs.
