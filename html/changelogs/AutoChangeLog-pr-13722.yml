changes:
  - refactor: Refactors some logic in the candidate poll system used by dynamic midround
      events.
  - tweak: Dynamic will wait until a candidate is available when a ruleset is executed,
      cancelling any existing polls if a previous event did not find a candidate.
  - tweak: Upon becoming a ghost, you will gain access to any candidate polls that
      are currently in progress.
  - tweak: Midround rulesets can now be selected as an option even if there are no
      ghosts, as upon execution it will simply wait until enough ghosts sign up before
      execution. This means that rulesets other than space pirates can execute on
      lowpop.
