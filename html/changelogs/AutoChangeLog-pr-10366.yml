changes:
  - rscadd: The viral extrapolator will now show if a disease is immutable, faltered,
      and/or a carrier.
  - tweak: The PanD.E.M.I.C will now copy properties such as faltering and immutability
      to newly made cultures.
  - tweak: Virus mixing reactions (i.e virus food, mutagen, spaceacillin, etc) won't
      occur if there's no mutable virus in the blood its mixing with.
  - code_imp: Cleaned up the PANDEMIC code a bit.
