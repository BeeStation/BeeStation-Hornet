changes:
  - bugfix: Fixed Space Heaters not having power cells roundstart
  - balance: Buffed Space Heater's ability to cool/heat rooms, upgrade their batteries
      and components to gain even more of that benefit. Seriously UPGRADE THEM.
  - refactor: Refactored construction code to use subtype instead of deleting old
      cell on construction, changed attackby to use default procs and early returns
  - code_imp: Added documentation and variables with snake cases
