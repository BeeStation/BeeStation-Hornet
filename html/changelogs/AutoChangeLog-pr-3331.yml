changes:
  - code_imp: The point of negative quirks is that you shouldn't be able to bypass
      them. You're taking a permanent handicap in exchange for other perks. Multiple
      fixes have been made to reflect this.
  - bugfix: You can no longer augment a paralyzed limb. No more bypassing being paraplegic.
  - bugfix: Light drinkers will treat alcohols with negative booze power as positive
      booze power.
  - balance: Motorized wheelchair now uses 1/4th of its previous power usage.
  - balance: Brain Tumor quirk now starts with mannitol.
