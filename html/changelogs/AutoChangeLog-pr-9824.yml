changes:
  - rscadd: New makeup & sprites on Nar'sie. Tell her how fashionable she looks next
      time she ~~invades~~ liberates your local plane of existence!
  - rscadd: New sprites for constructs. Dismember heathens, without the SOVL!
  - refactor: minor refactor of cult and holy versions of constructs, no ingame changes.
  - bugfix: Soulstones have an extra check that should mitigate instances where spaghetti
      would send players to the lobby
  - bugfix: fixes AI shells getting erroneously instantly converted by Twisted Construction
      spell
  - bugfix: fixes Cyborgs getting round removed by the Offer rune. They will properly
      transfer.
  - bugfix: fixes dead Cyborgs that are converted from being catatonic for the rest
      of the shift, ghosts will be yanked back inside during conversion
  - rscadd: makes all cult construction gear (forge, etcetera) use radial menus, instead
      of lists
  - rscadd: new minor construct, the Proteon! This is a weaker, but more agile construct
      that will be brought forth from the veil when Nar'Sie arrives, to hunt down
      the errant subjects of her new dominion!
