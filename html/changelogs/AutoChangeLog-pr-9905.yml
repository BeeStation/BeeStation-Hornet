changes:
  - code_imp: "added chat span classes for sorting only purpose (virtually. These\
      \ don't exist). when you want a chat to be sorted in a group, you need to use\
      \ \"srt_SOMETHING\" in this way: \"\\<span class='srt_deadchat'>\". This example\
      \ will sort a chat in deadchat group."
  - bugfix: most bad practices for chat sorting in radio group are fixed. non-radio
      messages will not be seen in radio group. (especially cult messages)
  - rscadd: 'some chats are now sorted into radio: holopara chats, blood/clock cult
      telepathy, etc'
