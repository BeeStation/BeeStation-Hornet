changes:
  - admin: Blackpowder and phlogiston now alert admins upon creation.
  - code_imp: All objects made primarily or entirely of plasma now have their reactions
      handled via atom/proc/plasma_ignition() instead of each having slight variations
      of almost the same code defined individually.
  - tweak: almost all objects made of plasma now react to being shot with lasers,
      attacked with hot objects such as lit welders, and being exposed to flames.
      This notably excludes plasma ore and plasma glass.
  - tweak: Ground plasma in beakers now ignites when exposed to any heat increase
      above ambient temperature. Chemists beware!
  - balance: Plasma gas is no longer created as a byproduct of solid plasma burning
      or spilling. Instead the various forms of solid plasma burn rapidly and brilliantly,
      resulting in a small explosion with a bright flash and wide but brief flame.
