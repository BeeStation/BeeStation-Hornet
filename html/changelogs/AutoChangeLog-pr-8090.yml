changes:
  - rscadd: ghost chat pref to toggle (F) option to all mobs or mind-having mobs in
      chat. with this, ghost will not see (F) button on emotes that are done by mobs
      having no mind. new players has this turned on by default (they see all), but
      old players should set this toggle if they want to see all mobs emote
