changes:
  - rscadd: Adds the turnstile, genpop interface, prisoner id and genpop lockers from
      NSV. Added workshop area to brig based on the holodeck code, where prisoners
      can make donuts or bots and scan them to get reduced sentences. Adds secure
      floors and prison grilles to help secure the prison area better.
  - tweak: Changed the path of the previous prisoner id used for gulag (now id/gulag).
      Updated paths of the current holodeck templates to holodeck/recreational to
      allow for easier subtypes implementation. Removed holographic flag preventing
      the crafting menu from working.
  - imageadd: Added sprites for the turnstile and genpop interface
