changes:
  - bugfix: Removes a sleep loop from airlocks
  - bugfix: Makes ruin generation a subsystem process rather than using CHECK_TICK,
      so that its execution flow can be managed by the MC rather than byond.
  - code_imp: Adds in a unit test for shuttle files that are just completely broken.
