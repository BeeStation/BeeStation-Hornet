changes:
  - rscadd: adds temperature regulators to space suits. These are heaters attached
      to the suit dependent on a battery life. Not significant for humans, but helpful
      for species that do not do well against the cold.
  - rscadd: hardsuit headlights are repairable after being hit by a nightmare's blade.
      Simply use a lightbulb on a hardsuit helmet
  - bugfix: breath air exhaled from carbons lungs matches the mobs bodytemperature
  - bugfix: Carbon hugging is now functional. It previously had the giver of the hug
      GAIN heat when hugging a colder person, instead of the other way around. Hugs
      were harmful!
