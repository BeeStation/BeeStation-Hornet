changes:
  - balance: Introduces an ammo management system for mech ballistics & missiles.
      Bullets are no longer auto-refilled by consuming a mechs energy, but instead
      rely on an internal cache. This cache can be refilled to up to 4x its gun capacity.
      A depleted cache must be refilled with special ammo boxes.
  - rscadd: Adds mech ammo boxes to Mechfabricators, Security Lathes, and Syndicate
      Bundles.
  - rscadd: Readds station-researchable missiles, the Breaching missile! Used to breach
      walls.
  - tweak: tweaks mech projectile values
