changes:
  - rscadd: Ported the mail system from /tg/.
  - rscadd: Cargo will gradually receive mail crates over time, which contains letters
      and packages to and for the crew. Cargo should make an attempt to deliver people's
      mail.
  - rscadd: add item scaling, used for the letters when they're on the ground (or
      the crate)
  - rscadd: New icons for the mailman outfit, and a new mailman outfit for plasmaman
  - rscadd: some more stamps compared to the port and a new bag.
  - tweak: from the port, the mail list has been adjusted and modified from /tg/,
      each job gets a bigger rooster of items from the item pool (between the generic
      list and the job dedicated lists).
