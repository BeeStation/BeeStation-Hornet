changes:
  - rscadd: Added the "Look Up" and "Look Down" Multi-Z verbs, with keybinds L (up)
      and ; (down).
  - rscadd: Added zmove keybinds, F for up, C for down.
  - rscadd: Added the Combustion Jetpack crate, an engineering crate that includes
      the combustion jetpack, which can move up and down in gravity as well as function
      in space like a normal jetpack. It burns a plasma-oxygen mix and is refillable
      (ideally at a ~50% ratio).
  - rscadd: Added z-level changing buttons to the advanced camera console.
  - balance: Zfalls now do more damage per level fallen, and felinids falling more
      than one level will still take damage, but reduced. Damage is also mostly applied
      to legs and split between the rest of the body in the case of missing or broken
      legs.
  - code_imp: Refactored multi-z sound code slightly.
  - tweak: Using an RCD on open space (above another z-level) will now place floors.
  - tweak: Placing lattices on open space no longer requires pixelhunting.
  - tweak: Tweaked failure messages for Move Upwards/Move Down verbs.
  - bugfix: Fixed zfalls stating that you fell one more z-level than you actually
      did.
  - bugfix: Fixed sound breaking when changing z-levels.
  - bugfix: Fixed various z-level changes not registering.
  - bugfix: You can no longer move up and down through catwalks, and you also cannot
      "float" up while in gravity.
  - bugfix: Fixed the move up/down animations being reversed.
  - code_imp: Removed a broken old deconstruction hint for catwalks.
  - bugfix: Fixed a runtime caused by zfalls.
  - bugfix: Fixed zfalls stopping midair after one level.
  - bugfix: Fixed AI camera static not updating when you move up and down.
  - bugfix: Fixed the removal of a lattice or catwalk under someone not triggering
      a zfall.
  - rscadd: Added jetpack and wing multiz flight. Regular jetpacks are not capable
      of enough thrust to resist gravity.
  - tweak: Moving up and down in space only takes 1 second, while in-gravity flight,
      etc take 3 seconds.
  - code_imp: Slightly optimized gravity code for ztrait-style gravity.
  - rscadd: Added the "rocket jetpack", a jetpack designed for in-gravity flight,
      that burns plasma and oxygen.
  - bugfix: Fixed nightmare multiz jaunting
  - tweak: Falling is no longer instant, there is a period of 0.2s between zlevels
      (you can even move onto a solid tile to "break" your fall)
  - tweak: You can now move during all types of zmove except for climbing (which is
      disabled currently).
