changes:
  - bugfix: IPC crit damage now checks the nocritdamage trait.
  - bugfix: IPC crit damage no longer accounts for robotic limb resilience that they
      dont have.
  - tweak: at maintainer request, ipc crit damage works like other species with nobreath
      (ipcs take 1 brute damage per life tick, as opposed to 6 burn damage.)
