changes:
  - admin: SDQL2 now supports all subsystems.
  - bugfix: Alarm Monitoring program changed to avoid always-on unclearable fire alarms
  - tweak: Hacking a firing pin out of a gun is no longer done via a crafting menu
      - you can now do it by simply holding the gun in your hand and clicking it with
      a welder/screwdriver/wirecutters
  - bugfix: You are no longer prevented from selecting more neutral/negative quirks
      once you have reached the limit of 6 positive ones.
  - bugfix: Fixed a scenario that allowed infinite resource generation via ore machines.
