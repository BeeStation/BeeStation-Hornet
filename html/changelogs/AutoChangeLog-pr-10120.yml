changes:
  - bugfix: Donk pockets now have their old nutriment value again, and their maltodextrin
      value has been updated to match this new (old) value as it should.
  - bugfix: Dank pockets can now be microwaved again
  - tweak: The amount of maltodextrin in premade donuts and ramen is now correct after
      having been missed in the previous PR.
  - code_imp: Adds proper list spacing to snacks_and_vend.dm items containing maltodextrin
      and cleans up some unused variables
