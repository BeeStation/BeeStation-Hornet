changes:
  - bugfix: Unintentionally buffed bola durations have been reverted to their prior
      values. Energy bolas will last for 3 seconds and reinforced bolas for 7 seconds,
      down from being accidentally buffed to 5 and 10 respectively.
  - tweak: Rather than applying a hardcoded slowdown when hit with a bola, players
      are knocked down for the intended escape duration and bolas will automatically
      fall off after the intended duration is up
  - tweak: Energy bolas are no longer consumed upon hitting a target
  - tweak: Gonbolas have had their duration reduced from 30 seconds to 10 seconds
      since they are also knockdown instead of just a pacification tool now.
