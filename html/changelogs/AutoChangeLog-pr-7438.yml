changes:
  - balance: Changed most dynamic weights, threats, and minimum player requirements.
      They will all be different and hopefully more balanced now.
  - bugfix: dynamic will no longer spawn abductors if there aren't enough applicants
      for a proper 2-person abductor team
  - rscadd: Revenant, Space Pirates, and Obsessed have been added to dynamic mode.
  - bugfix: Fixes the lone operative event hardly ever rolling even if the disk is
      left on the same place for hours on dynamic.
  - server: Dynamic now has an extra configuration value, max_threat_level. Defaults
      to 100 threat.
  - balance: Makes wizard a high impact ruleset.
  - bugfix: A lack of candidates for certain antags will no longer runtime
  - balance: Midround rolls will now happen more frequently, with their power scaling
      up over time.
  - bugfix: Fixed midrounds not logging properly.
  - balance: Winning dynamic revs no longer adds midround threat. Instead, it'll force
      a heavy ruleset to spawn, and barring that, will spawn a dangerous random event.
  - server: Added more dynamic logging
