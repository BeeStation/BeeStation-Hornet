changes:
  - rscdel: Removed exploit that allowed you to get money by buying and selling crates.
  - tweak: Many single pack crates removed due to said exploit. Added bulk versions
      instead for very reasonable prices.
  - balance: Rebalanced a ton of crates according to math. Many crates had you paying
      more for the bulk option than the single pack.
