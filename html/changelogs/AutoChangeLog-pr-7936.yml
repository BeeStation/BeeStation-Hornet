changes:
  - balance: basic medicines (Bicaridine, Kelotane, Anti-toxin, Dexalin, Tricordrazine)
      are less effective over 20 damage ("if(prob(100/(2**(round(PLAYER_DAMAGE / 20
      )))))") 100% chance to heal, but for every 20 damage you have, the chance is
      halved. (100% / 50% at 20 / 25% at 40 / 12.5% at 60).
  - balance: Bicaridine/Kelotane/Anti-toxin heals 0.5 (brute/burn/toxin)
  - balance: Dexalin heals 1.5 (oxy damage)
  - balance: Tricordrazine heals 1 (4 types), metabolisation rate is 1.2u, max overdose
      is now 50u.
