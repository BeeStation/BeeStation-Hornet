changes:
  - rscadd: Lockers, crates, and machines no longer block click attempts in adjacency
      checks. Basically, you can reach tables cornered between lockers/machines.
  - code_imp: Adds a new pass_flags_self flag called LETPASSCLICKS that lets you mark
      an atom to not block ClickCross() attempts.
