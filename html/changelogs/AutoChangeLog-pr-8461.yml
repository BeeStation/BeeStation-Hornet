changes:
  - code_imp: Added a new subtype of labcoat used by doctors, and shifted the CMO,
      paramedic and brig physician typepaths into this subtype
  - tweak: All doctor labcoats can now store medkits in their suit storage slot
  - tweak: Medkits are now bulky items that cannot be stored in bags, with exception
      to the syndicate combat medkit.
  - bugfix: Paramedics can now add the EMT Labcoat from the beecoin shop to their
      loadout. Geneticists and Chemists have lost access to this loadout option.
