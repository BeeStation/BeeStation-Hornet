changes:
  - rscadd: Added Nanite Protocols, special programs that allow for you to 'upgrade'
      some part of your nanites, usually with some tradeoff or downside.
  - rscadd: Added Blood Sensor and Nutrition Sensor nanite programs.
  - rscadd: Added the Nanite Blade program to nanites, which allows you to manifest
      an armblade similar to the xenobio one, locked behind illegal tech.
  - rscadd: Added the Vampiric Synthesis program to nanites, which allows you to generate
      nanite volume using your own blood volume. This WILL suck you dry if you let
      it, please use this with a blood sensor or something! No, you can't cheese it
      with Blood Regeneration.
  - rscadd: Added the Remote Signaler program to nanites, which functions similarly
      to, well, a remote signaler!
  - rscadd: Added the Remote Signal Receiver program to nanites, which allows you
      to receive remote signaler signals and translate them into nanite signals!
  - rscadd: Added the Dermal Toggle program to nanites, which is similar to a dermal
      button, but it's an on/off toggle instead.
  - rscadd: You can now combine nanite rules, for more advanced logic!
  - rscadd: Nanite Cloud Controllers now have neat lil' popup bubbles whenever you
      do an action on 'em.
  - balance: Researching harmonic nanite tech now provides a 0.1/sec passive regen
      rate boost to all nanites!
  - tweak: Metabolic Synthesis no longer has a built in-limiter, and can consume ALL
      your nutrition if you allow it to.
  - balance: Infective exo-locomotion shouldn't be completely useless anymore.
  - rscadd: Nanite communication remotes, which can send text communications to certain
      nanite programs, are now actually buildable
