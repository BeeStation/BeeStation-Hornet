changes:
  - rscadd: Adds a new "Large" weight class for items, between normal and bulky. Largel
      items fit inside of backpacks, but take up twice as much space as normal items
      do.
  - balance: Several normal items have been changed to Large, including boxes, guns,
      stun batons, and a variety of other items without major balance implications.
  - tweak: Belts of all varieties are now bulky items and no longer fit into backpacks.
  - tweak: Boxes have had their storage capacity reduced dramatically so that the
      space they take up inside of a bag matches the amount of storage space they
      have inside.
  - tweak: The emergency internals box that all players spawn with is smaller than
      most other boxes, but may only store emergency equipment and tiny items.
  - tweak: All backpacks have had an increase in their base storage capacity to make
      up for the loss of storage space in your roundstart box.
  - tweak: Fanny packs have had their storage capacity increased from 3 slots to 5,
      and may now hold normal sized items. Fanny packs are primarily craftable by
      botanists and are considered belts.
  - tweak: All other belts now have 7 slots if they didn't already, this most notably
      impacts security officers who will find their belts have 2 additional slots.
  - tweak: Most security personnel now spawn with a loaded belt instead of a loose
      baton, cuffs and flash.
  - tweak: Detectives now spawn with a 5-slot "utility" belt that holds some of their
      tools that were previously loose. This belt is actually just a renamed fanny
      pack and can hold anything they want however.
  - tweak: Holsters now have one less slot, and may hold loose bullets instead of
      only full clips. Detective holsters no longer spawn pre-loaded with ammo.
  - tweak: Boxes of shotgun ammo no longer fit in sec belts, however individual shotgun
      shells do.
  - tweak: Medkits are now large items instead of bulky and can fit into bags again.
      These same medkits no longer fit in suit slots or belt slots.
  - tweak: The extra large medkit that several medical roles spawn with is now a "doctor's
      bag". The doctor's bag fits in in the suit slot of all labcoats, including those
      previously excluded from storing medkits.
  - tweak: Compressed matter cartridges now fit inside of construction bags
  - tweak: The emergency survival boxes everyone spawns with have a new icon showing
      they contain an emergency O2 tank.
  - code_imp: Adds a new procs to `obj/item/` for increasing and decreasing weight
      by one class
