changes:
  - rscadd: The disease extrapolator, a scanner that can scan or extract diseases
      and their symptoms, whatever they're in. it spawns in viro and the cmo locker,
      and virologists start with one
  - rscadd: mice, vector, old bloodstains, crusty vomit, and used syringes can now
      contain extractable diseases. A few more minor sources also contain diseases
      to extract
  - rscadd: sharing syringes spreads diseases
  - rscdel: viro no longer spawns with highly potent viral base
  - tweak: viro now has maint access
  - tweak: medical lathe can print scanning modules
  - bugfix: fixed double-viro on box and meta. no idea when it got reverted, and why
      it was only on two maps...
  - imageadd: extrapolator sprites
  - tweak: maint is a bit grosser
