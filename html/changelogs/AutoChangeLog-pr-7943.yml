changes:
  - rscadd: 'Added a new Scientist crew objective: "Make sure the research for [X
      design] is available on the R&D server by the end of the shift."'
  - rscdel: Removed the Chemistry "Have X pills containing X" crew objective.
  - rscdel: Removed the Chemistry "Have X in your bloodstream" crew objective.
  - rscadd: Added a new Chemistry crew objective "Have at least X units total of (X
      chemical) in the chemistry smartfridge(s) or with you when the shift ends."
      - it requires actually useful chems to be made.
  - tweak: The Roboticist crew objective "Make X cyborgs" has been changed from 2-10
      to 1-3, and it now also mentions that AI shells count.
  - tweak: The janitor "keep X areas clean" objective no longer requires them to be
      completely spotless, instead requiring that you keep it clean under 12-20 "cleanables"
      per area.
  - tweak: The janitor "keep X areas clean" objective no longer makes you clean maintenance.
  - bugfix: Fixed the Curator newscaster objective not working.
  - tweak: The Curator newscaster objective now uses word counts and is more reasonable
      in its expectations.
  - bugfix: The lawyer's "Ensure there are no members of security in the prison wing
      when the shift ends." crew objective no longer does the opposite.
  - bugfix: The virologist "Ensure no crew have harmful diseases" objective now properly
      checks the harm level of the disease instead of targeting harmless disease,
      and properly checks that the disease-haver is living before failing.
  - bugfix: Fixed a runtime with the Mime "Don't break your vow" crew objective.
  - bugfix: Fixed crew objectives showing as failed if you break the completion conditions
      and then re-open the roundend report.
  - bugfix: Fixed some formatting and spacing issues with the janitor area clean objective.
  - bugfix: The mime's "never break your vow" crew objective now checks if you broke
      the vow directly instead of if you talked at all (with false positives from
      dchat).
  - code_imp: Improved crew objective code.
