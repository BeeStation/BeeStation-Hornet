      crew is to catch him during a vunerable moment.
  - rscremove: Due to the addition of proper liching, skeletons as a choosable race

      is used for all the remaining calculations instead of Armour (Eg: 80 Melee -

  - rscadd: The spells disintegrate and flesh to stone have had their mechanics changed.
      Using these spells will spawn a special touch weapon in a free hand (your dominant
      hand if possible) that can then be used to inflict the spell on the target of
      your choice. Having the touch weapon out is obvious, this is not a stealth based
      change. Clicking the spell while the hand is out will let you return the charge
      without using it.
  - rscdel: The spell won't begin to recharge until the hand attack is either used
      or returned. Additionally these changes mean you can no longer use these spells
      while stunned or handcuffed. As a suggestion remember that the mutate spell
      allows you to break out of cuffs very easily, and warping abilities will keep
      you from getting cuffed to begin with!

  - rscdel: Removed feature where quick consecutive ghost orbits while moving could
      be used to fuck with your sprite

      thing moved in certain situations.
  - rscadd: Ghost Orbit size now changes based on the icon size of the thing they
      are orbiting (for that sweet sweet singulo orbiting action)

      needles - they are now able to penetrate armor.

  Gun Hog, for WJohnston:

      way to growing into a full queen, and a queen may promote one if there is not
      one already.'

      they are considered royals.

  - bugfix: All forms of dead xenomorph may now be grabbed and placed on a surgery
      table for organ harvesting!

  - tweak: A recent Nanotrasen firmware update to drones has increased vulnerability
      to foreign influences. Please periodically check drones for abnormal behavior
      or status LED malfunction. Note, however, that cryptographic sequencers will
      not incur this behavior.
  - tweak: In response to complaints about rogue drones, Nanotrasen engineers have
      allowed factory resets on all drones by simply using a wrench.
  - experiment: Central Command reminds drones to immediately retreat, if possible,
      when a law override is begun. Not doing so may anger the gods and incur their
      wrath!
  - rscadd: Some virus symptoms that had no messages now have them.
  - rscadd: 'New virology symptom: Weakness. This will cause stamina damage and fainting
      spells.'

      scanning module which will display the potential research data gained from experimenting
      with an object. Nanotrasen has also released drivers which shall enable the
      prototype hardsuit's built in scan visor.
  - rscadd: Supporting this new design, Nanotrasen has seen fit to provide blueprints
      for Science Goggles to the station's protolathe.

      will have to use a pen to convert them afterwards.

      the detectives hat.
  - sounddel: When Nar-Sie is created, they now use the old sound effect.

  - experiment: After searching through the Sleeping Carp's ancient monastery in deep
      space, more secrets have been uncovered of their traditional fighting techniques.

      to butcher their corpse to retrieve their contents.
  - bugfix: butchering a corpse no longer also attacks it.

  - tweak: Slimes now attaches themselves to mobs via buckling.
2015-10-16:
  MrStonedOne:
  - rscadd: Added a reconnect option to the file menu. This will allow you to reconnect
      to the game server without closing and re-opening the game window. This should
      also prevent another byond ad from playing during reconnections.
  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: A gamebreaking bug has been fixed with buckets. You can now wear them
      on your head.
  bgobandit:
  - rscadd: The Grape Growers Consortium has complained that Nanotrasen kitchens do

      to drone legs. They are no longer affected by lack of gravity or spacewind!
  - bugfix: Drones can now set Airlock access on RCDs.
  bgobandit:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen loves recycling! In the highly unlikely occasion that your
      space station accumulates gibs, scoop 'em up and bring them to chemistry to
      recycle into soap, candles, or even delicious meat product!
  - rscadd: L3 biohazard closets now contain bio-bag satchels for the safe collection
      of biowaste products, such as slime extracts.

      glass) is now done by clicking them, similar to spray. Reagent dispensers (watertank,
      fueltank, pepperspray dispenser) no longer have their own transfer amounts and
      use the reagent container's transfer amount instead (except for sprays which
      get 50u for faster refilling).
2015-10-23:
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: 'Syndicate bomb payloads will now detonate if set on fire long enough.
      Note that the casings for the bombs is fireproof, so if you want to set fire
      to a bombcore you''ll need to remove it from the case first (cut all wires,
      then crowbar it out). A reassurance from our explosives department: it is, and
      always has been, impossible to detonate a syndicate bomb that isn''t ticking
      with wirecutters alone.'
  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: Geiger counters have been added and are obtainable from autolathes and
      EngiVends. They will measure the severity of radiation pulses while in your
      pockets, belt, or hands. One can scan a mob's radiation level by switching to
      Help intent and clicking on it. These counters never really discard the radiation
      they store, and rumor has it this can be used in nefarious ways...
  - tweak: When a mob is impacted by radiation, the radiation is now relayed to all
      items on the mob.
2015-10-24:
  Kor:
  - rscadd: The friendly gold slime reaction now spawns three mobs.
  phil235:
  - tweak: Changed the effects of alcohol to be more realistic. The effects of alcohol
      now appear twice as fast. Drunkenness now scales with how much alcohol is in
      you, not how long you've been drinking. This means drinking very little but
      continuously no longer makes you very drunk, or confused/slurring for a long
      time or give you alcohol poisoning. The dizziness and slurring effects now properly
      scale with how drunk you are (and dizziness is generally more pronounced).
2015-10-25:
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: The spell Charge has been added to the spellbook. It can be used to extend
      the life of magic and energy weapons and even reset the cooldowns of held wizards!

      and raises the dead! Can't be used on yourself however.

2015-10-26:
  Fox P McCloud:
  - tweak: Standardizes the slowdown of most spacesuits to 1 as opposed to 2.
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: 48x48 pixel mode (x1.5 zoom) has been added to the Icons menu (top left).
      While playing in 32x32 or 64x64 will still provide a clearer looking station,
      for those of us with resolutions that fall into the gap between the two zooms
      this can provide a more consistant looking station than stretch to fit.
  - rscadd: 96x96 pixel mode (x3 zoom) has also been added for our players who enjoy
      looking at spacemen on their 4k monitors at a crisp and consistent scale.
  - tweak: The lich spell has been subjected to some gentle nerfing. When you die
      a string of energy will tie your new body to your old body for a short time,
      aiding others in determining your location. The duration of this beam scales
      with the number of deaths you've avoided.
  - tweak: Additionally the post revival stun now also scales in this way.
  - tweak: The spell will also fail if the item and the wizard don't share the same
      z level, though the nature of space means the odds of the item (or the wizard)
      looping around back to the station is pretty high.
  - rscadd: The spell is still really good.
2015-10-27:
  Joan:
  - bugfix: You can now click on things under timestop effects, instead of clicking
      the effect and looking like a fool.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: Added a zombie mob that turns its kills into more zombies. Currently adminspawn
      and xenobio only.
  - rscadd: Using water with a red slime extract will now yield a speed potion. Using

  MrStonedOne:
  - rscadd: You may now access the setup character screen when not in the lobby via
      the game preferences verb in the preferences tab
  - rscadd: The round end restart delay can now be configured by server operators.
      New servers will default to 90 seconds while old servers will default to the
      old 25 seconds until they import the config option to their server.
2015-10-28:

      (jobs only) or the medHUD of humans.
  - rscadd: Ghost will now get clickable icon alerts from events such as being put
      in a cloner, drones being created, Nar-sie being summoned, among others. The
      older chat messages were kept. These alerts can not be toggled.

      saving some annoying inventory shuffle at roundstart.
2015-10-30:
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: Slimepeople can now split if they contain 200 units of slime jelly, and
      slimepeople will now slowly generate slime jelly up to 200 units provided they
      are very well fed. Split slimepeople are NOT player controlled, but rather the
      original slime person can swap between the two mobs at will. If one of the slimepeople
      should die under player control, the player won't be able to swap back to their
      living body. Splitting only creates a new body, any items you have on you are
      not duplicated.
  - rscadd: Slimepeople now take half damage from sources of heat, but double damage
      from sources of cold. Lasers good, Space bad.
2015-11-01:
  Gun Hog:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen listens! After numerous complaints and petitions from Security
      personnel regarding energy weapon upkeep, we have authorized the construction
      and maintenance of your station's weapon rechargers. As an added bonus, we have
      also provided a more modular design for the devices, allowing for greater recharge
      rates if fitted with a more efficient capacitor!
  - rscadd: Added Diagnostic HUDs! They can be used to view the health and cell status
      of borgs and mechs. Silicons have them built in, Roboticists get two in their
      locker, and the RD's hardsuit has one built in.
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: The number of roundstart head revolutionaries nows depends on the roundstart
      security force as well as the roundstart heads
  - rscadd: The maximum number of head revs is 3, the minimum is 1. If there is fewer
      than three station heads there will never be more than that number of head revs
      at roundstart. For every three vacant security roles (Head of Security/Warden/Security
      Officer/Detective) at roundstart the number of starting head revs will be reduced
      by 1.
  - rscadd: Head revolutionaries can be gained during play if the security/head roles
      are filled. They are drawn from existing revolutionaries.
  - rscadd: Added dental implant surgery. While targeting the mouth drill a hole in
      a tooth then stick a pill in there for hands free later use.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: Added an experimental control console for Xenobiology. Ask the admins
      if you'd like to try it out. It may not work on maps other than Box if they
      have renamed the Xenobiology Lab.
  - rscadd: Injecting blood into a cerulean slime will yield a special one use set
      of blueprints that will allow you to expand the territory your camera can cover.
  Kor and Remie:
  - rscadd: Added as series of laser reflector structures, the frame of which can
      be built with 5 metal sheets.
  - rscadd: Completing the frame with 5 glass sheets creates a mirror that will reflect
      lasers at a 90 degree angle.
  - rscadd: Completing the frame with 10 reinforced glass sheets creates a double
      sided mirror that reflects lasers at a 90 degree angle.
  - rscadd: Completing the frame with a single diamond sheet creates a box that will
      redirect all lasers that hit it from any angle in a single direction.

      button.
  - rscadd: Added new outfit that allows admins to dress people up in the chrono equipment
      easier.

      by dragging the target away.

  - tweak: Revenant ability costs tweaked; Defile now costs 40 essence to cast, Overload
      Lights now costs 45 essence to cast, and Malfunction now costs 50 essence to
      cast.
  - tweak: Malfunction now affects non-machine objects, even if they're not being
      held by a human.
  - tweak: Defile does an extremely low amount of toxin damage to humans and confuses,
      but does much less stamina damage and stuns the revenant for slightly longer.
  - tweak: Overload Lights will no longer shock if the light is broken after a light
      is chosen to shock an area.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: Using water on a dark blue slime extract will now yield a new potion capable

  - tweak: Bluespace anomaly will occasionally teleport mobs away from it in a small
      radius.

      things.
  MrStonedOne:
  - bugfix: Away mission loading will no longer improperly expand the width of the

  - rscdel: You can no longer throw the bolt whenever you want, it will fire itself
      once it's done charging.
  - rscadd: Getting hit by a bolt will do a flat 30 burn now, as opposed to scaling
      with how long the wizard spent charging the spell. Unless said wizard made a
      habit of charging lightning bolt to near maximum every time this is a buff to
      damage.
  - rscdel: Every time the bolt jumps the next shock will do five less burn damage.
  - rscadd: Lightning bolts can still jump back to the same body, so the maximum number
      of bolts you can be hit by in a single casting is three, and the maximum amount
      of damage you could take for that is 60 burn.

  PKPenguin321:
  - rscadd: Teleprods can now be constructed. Make them via tablecrafting, or by putting
      a bluespace crystal onto a stunprod. They warp the target to a random nearby

      walls around the camera. On the other hand, cameras with an xray upgrade let
      you see through walls. Unfocused camera now give you the same effect as when
      you are nearsighted. Being inside closets, morgue container and disposal bins
      give you some vision impairments.

      whenever they're on blobs near a node or the core.
  - tweak: Blob expansion no longer has a chance to fail inversely proportional with
      the expanding blob's health. Blobs still, however, expand at roughly the same
      rate as they do currently.

  - rscadd: Adds Penetrating Spines, which is sea green and does brute damage through
      armor. The damage can still be reduced by bio protection.

      the nearby area when hit with brute damage projectiles, from just when attacked
      by brute damage in melee.

      the 'blob' faction, such as blobbernauts and spores.

      balls. First ball comes with 32 energy (down from 300), fourth requires 256
      (down from 1200), and so on and on, doubling with each new ball. Balls after
      7 are increasingly harder to get than before, whereas balls before 6 are easier
      to get.
  - rscadd: MULTIBOLT IS BACK!

      twice the power of a stage 3 singulo with maxed collectors without any balls,

      in half to make tablecrafting less annoying to use.

      brain can't be put into a robot, they can still be put inside a brainless humanoid
      corpse and cloned, but deffibing the corpse always fails (can't revive someone
      with a brain beaten to a pulp).

      bodies since they're the only ones that have hair. Sorry lizards and plasmamen!
      You'll get your turn next time.

      you want your ghost sprite to show both hair and directional sprites, only directional

      and lets you configure how other ghosts appear to you: as their own setting,
      as the form they chose but without any hair or directional sprites, or as the
      simple white ghost sprite if you''re sick of those premium users with their
      rainbow ghosts.'
  - experiment: The layout of the ghost preference buttons has slightly changed. The
      old Choose Ghost Form and Choose Ghost Orbit are now a part of Ghost Customization,
      which also contains the new Ghost Accessories button. Clicking Ghost Customization
      will send you directly to Ghost Accessories if you don't have premium. The Preferences
      tab now also contains the Ghost Display button, which lets you configure how
      other ghosts appear to you.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where the toggles for Ghost Accessories and Ghosts of Others
      in the Preferences menu wouldn't save your preference update to your save file.

      energy sword, dualsaber) to prevent them taking limbs off in a single hit.
  - rscadd: The chaplain has two new weapons (they are mechanically identical to previous

  Robustin:
  - experiment: There are rumors that the Cult's 'Talisman of Construction', which
      turns ordinary metal for construct shells, can be used on plasteel to create
      structures. If the stories are true, the cult has been producing relics of incredible
      power through this transmutation.
  coiax:

  - rscadd: Lings have a new default ability, Hivemind Link. This lets you bring a
      neck-grabbed victim into hivemind communications after short period of time.
      You can talk to victims who are in crit/muted and perhaps persuade them to help
      you, give you intel, or even a PDA code. The link will stabilize crit victims
      to help ensure they do not die during the link.

  nullbear:
  - tweak: Wetness updates less often.
  - rscadd: Wetness now stacks. Spraying lube over a tile that already has lube, will
      make the lube take longer to dry. Likewise, dumping 100 units of lube will take
      longer to dry than if only 10 units were dumped. (lube used to last just as
      long, regardless of whether it was 1u, or 100u) There is a limit, however, and
      you can't stack infinite lube.
  - tweak: Hotter temperatures cause water to evaporate more quickly. At 100C, water
      will boil away instantly.
  - rscadd: About 5 seconds of wetness are removed from a tile for each unit of drying
      agent. Absorbant Galoshes remain the most effective method of drying, and dry

  coiax:
  - rscdel: Gatling gun removed from R&D for pressing ceremonial reasons.
  phil235:
  - tweak: Pull and Grab are merged together. Pulling stays unchanged. Using an empty
      hand with grab intent on a mob will pull them. Using an empty hand with grab
      intent on a mob that you're already pulling will try to upgrade your grip to
      aggressive grab>neck grab>kill grab. Aggressive grabs no longer stun you, but
      they act exactly like a handcuff, preventing you from using your hands until
      you escape the grip. You can break free from the grip by trying to move or using
      the resist button.
  - tweak: Someone pulling a restrained mob now swap position with them instead of
      getting blocked by the mob, unable to even push them.

      head to stop it coming back.

  - rscadd: Added clockwork reclaimers. Ghosts can now click on Ratvar to become clockwork
      reclaimers - small constructs capable of forcefully converting those that still
      resist Ratvar's reign. Alt-clicking a valid target will allow the reclaimer
      to leap onto the head of any non-servant, latching onto their head and converting
      the target if they are able. The target will be outfitted with an unremovable,
      acid-proof hat version of the reclaimer. The reclaimer will be able to speak
      as normal and attack its host and anything nearby. If the reclaimer's host goes
      unconscious or dies, it will leap free.
  - rscadd: Added pinion airlocks. These airlocks can only be opened by servants and
      conventional deconstruction will not work on them. They can be created by proselytizing

  - rscadd: Clockwork walls drop a wall gear when removed by a welding tool. The wall
      gear is dense, but can be climbed over or unwrenched, and drops alloy shards
      when broken. Clockwork walls drop alloy shards when broken by other means.

  - rscadd: The CMO's medical HUD implant now comes with a one-use autoimplanter for
      ease of use.
  RemieRichards:
  - rscadd: Slimes may now be ordered to attack! You must be VERY good friends with
      the slime(s) to give this command, asking them to attack their friends or other
      slimes will result in them liking you less so be careful!
  X-TheDark:
  - rscadd: Mech battery replacement improved. The inserted battery's charge will
      be set to the same percentage of the removed one's (or 10%, if removed one's
      was less).
  coiax:
  - bugfix: Clicking the (F) link when an AI talks in binary chat will follow its
      camera eye, the same as when (F) is clicked for its radio chat.
  - bugfix: Laughter demons should now always let their friends go when asked correctly.
  - rscadd: Cloning pods now grab the clone's mind when the body is ejected, rather
      than when it starts cloning.
  - rscadd: Wizards have been experimenting with summoning the slightly less lethal
      "laughter demon". Please be aware that these demons appear to be nearly as dangerous
      as their slaughter cousins. But adorable, nonetheless.
  kevinz000:
  - rscadd: Gravity Guns! It is a mildly expensive R&D gun that has a 5 second cooldown
      between shots, but doesn't need to be recharged. It has two modes, attract and
      repulse. For all your gravity-manipulation needs!
2016-06-07:
  Bobylein:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen is finally able to source transparent bottles for chemistry.
  Iamgoofball:
  - experiment: The Greytide Virus got some teeth.
  Joan:
  - wip: This is a bunch of Clockwork Cult changes.
  - rscadd: Added the Clockwork Obelisk, an Application scripture that produces a
      clockwork obelisk, which can Hierophant Broadcast a large message to all servants
      or open a Spatial Gateway with 5 uses and a 10 second duration to any conscious
      servant or clockwork obelisk.
  - wip: Spatial Gateways of any source have doubled uses and duration when the target
      is a clockwork obelisk.
  - rscadd: Added the Mania Motor, an Application scripture that produces a mania
      motor, which, while active, causes hallucinations and brain damage in all nearby
      humans.
  - wip: The Mania Motor will try to convert any non-servant human directly adjacent
      to it at an additional power cost and will remove brain damage, hallucinations,
      and the druggy effect from servants.
  - rscadd: Added the Vitality Matrix, an Application scripture that produces a sigil
      that will slowly drain health from non-servants that remain on it. Servants
      that remain on the sigil will instead be healed with the vitality drained from
      non-servants.
  - wip: The Vitality Matrix can revive dead servants for a cost of 25 vitality plus
      all non-oxygen damage the servant has. If it cannot immediately revive a servant,
      it will still heal their corpse.
  - experiment: Most clockwork structures, including the Mending Motor, Interdiction
      Lens, and the newly added Clockwork Obelisk and Mania Motor, now require power
      to function.
  - wip: Mending Motors can still use alloy for power.
  - tweak: The Sigil of Transmission has been remade into a power battery and will
      power directly adjecent clockwork structures. Sigils of Transmission start off
      with 4000 power and can be recharged with Volt Void.
  - tweak: Volt Void drains somewhat more power, but will not damage the invoker unless
      they drain too much power. Invokers with augmented limbs will instead have those
      limbs healed unless they drain especially massive amounts of power.
  - wip: Using Volt Void on top of a Sigil of Transmission will transfer most of the
      power drained to the Sigil of Transmission, effectively making it far less likely
      to damage the invoker.
  - rscdel: You can no longer stack most sigils and clockwork objects with themself.
      You can still have multiple different objects or sigils on a tile, however.
  - tweak: The Break Will Script has been renamed to Dementia Doctrine, is slightly
      faster, and causes slightly more brain damage.
  - tweak: The Judicial Visor now uses an action button instead of alt-click. Cultists
      of Nar-Sie judged by the visor will be stunned for half duration, but will be
      set on fire.
  - tweak: Multiple scriptures have had their component requirements changed. The
      Summon Judicial Visor Script has been reduced from a Script to a Driver.
  - rscadd: Recollection will now show both required and consumed components.
  - tweak: Clockwork Marauders can now emerge from their host if their host is at
      or below 60% total health(for humans, this is 20 health out of crit)
  - tweak: Clockwork Marauders will slowly heal if directly adjacent to their host
      and have a slightly larger threshold for their no-Fatigue bonus damage.
  Quiltyquilty:
  - rscadd: Botany, atmospherics and cargo now all have access to high-capacity watertanks.
  - rscadd: The bar has now been outfitted with custom bar stools.
  Xhuis:
  - rscdel: Removed the global message played when Nar-Sie _begins_ to spawn (but
      not when it actually spawns).
  - tweak: Drunkenness recovery speed now increases with how drunk the imbiber is
      and is much quicker when the imbiber is asleep.
  - tweak: Suit storage units now take three seconds to enter (up from one) and have
      different sounds and messages for UV ray cauterization.
  - bugfix: Fixed some bugs with the suit storage unit, inserting mobs, and contents
      to seemed to duplicate themselves.
  - bugfix: The Summon Nar-Sie rune can now only be drawn on original station tiles
      and fails to invoke if scribed on the station then moved elsewhere.
  coiax:
  - rscdel: Bluespace shelter capsules can no longer be used on shuttles.
  - rscadd: Bluespace shelters may have different capsules stored. View what your
      capsule has inside by examining it.
  - rscdel: The Nar'sie rune cannot be scribed on shuttles or off Z-level.
  - rscadd: The Raise Dead rune automatically grabs the ghost of the raised corpse.
  - rscadd: Deadchat is now notified when a sentient mob dies.
  phil235:
  - rscadd: Monkeys and all other animals that should have blood now has it. Beating
      them up will make you and your weapon bloody, just like beating a human does.
      Dragging them when wounded and lying will leave a blood trail. Their blood is
      still mostly cosmetic, they suffer no effects from low blood level, unlike humans.
  - rscadd: When a mob leaves a blood trail while dragged, it loses blood. You can
      no longer drag a corpse to make an inifinite amount of blood trails, because
      once the victim's blood reaches a certain threshold it no longer leaves a blood
      trail (and no longer lose any more blood). The threshold depends on how much
      damage the mob has taken. You can always avoid hurting the dragged mob by making
      them stand up or by buckling them to something or by putting them in a container.
  - rscdel: You can no longer empty a mob of its blood entirely with a syringe, once
      the mob's blood volume reaches a critically low level you are unable to draw
      any more blood from it.
  - tweak: A changeling absorbing a human now sucks all their blood.
2016-06-08:
  Cruix:
  - bugfix: Changelings no longer lose the regenerate ability if they respect while
      in regenerative stasis.
  Fox McCloud:
  - bugfix: Fixes Experimentor critical reactions not working
  - bugfix: Fixes Experimentor item cloning not working
  - bugfix: Fixes Experimentor producing coffee vending machines instead of coffe
      cups
  - tweak: Experimentor can only clone critical reaction items instead of anything
      with an origin tech
  GunHog:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen has approved the Hyper-Kenetic Accelerator upgrade for cyborg
      mining modules.
  - tweak: Each of the heads' ID computers are now themed for their department!
  Joan:
  - tweak: Anima Fragments have slightly more health and move faster, but slow down
      temporarily when taking damage. Also they can move in space now.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: The clown will play a sad trombone noise upon death.
  - rscadd: Colossi now roam the wastes.
  - rscadd: Bubblegum now roams the wastes.
  PKPenguin321:

      the bar, to unlock illegal chemicals.
  lordpidey:
  - tweak: Infernal jaunt has been significantly nerfed with an enter and exit delay.
2016-06-09:
  GunHog:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen scientists have completed a design for adapting mining cyborgs
      to the Lavaland Wastes in the form of anti-ash storm plating. Research for this
      technology must be adapted at your local station.
  Joan:
  - tweak: Anima Fragments have slightly less health and damage and will slow down
      for longer when hit.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: The captain now spawns with the station charter, which allows him to name
      the station.
  Papa Bones:
  - tweak: Loyalty implants have been refluffed to mindshield implants, they are mechanically
      the same.
  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: You can now remove all plants and weeds from a hydroponics tray by using
      a spade on it.
  - rscadd: Added meatwheat, a mutated variant of wheat that can be crushed into meat
      substitute.
  - rscadd: Added ambrosia gaia, a mysterious plant that is rumored to provide nutrients
      and water to any soil - hydroponic or otherwise - that it's planted in.
  - rscadd: Added cherry bombs, a mutated variant of blue cherries that have an explosively
      good taste. Oh, and don't pluck the stems.
  coiax:
  - tweak: The beacons from support guardians are now structures, rather than replacing
      the floor tile. In practice, this will change little, aside from not leaving
      empty plating when a beacon is removed because a new one has been placed.
  nullbear:
  - tweak: Removes the restriction on wormhole jaunters, preventing them from teleporting
      you to beacons on other z-levels.
  - tweak: No longer able to use beacons to bypass normal shuttle/centcomm anti-bluespace
      measures.
2016-06-11:
  Joan:
  - rscadd: Clockwork Slabs, Clockwork Caches near walls, and Tinkerer's Daemons will
      now be more likely to generate components that the clockwork cult has the least
      of.
  - rscadd: Destroyed Clockwork Caches will drop all Tinkerer's Daemons in them.
  - tweak: Clockwork Caches can now only generate a component every 30 seconds(when
      near a clockwork wall), Clockwork Slabs can only generate a component every
      40 seconds, and Tinkerer's Daemons can only generate a component every 20 seconds.
      This should result in higher component generation for everything except Clockwork
      Caches near clockwork walls.
  - tweak: Adding a component to a Clockwork Slab instead puts that component in the
      global component cache.
  - tweak: Clockwork Slabs only generate components if held by a mob or in a mob's
      storage, and when generating a component will prevent other Slabs held from
      generating a component.
  - tweak: The Replicant Driver no longer costs a Replicant Alloy to invoke; basically
      you can throw free Slabs at converts.
  - rscdel: Clockwork Slabs no longer have Repository as a menu option; instead, you
      can examine them to see how many components they have access to.
  - rscdel: Clockwork Caches directly on top of clockwork walls won't generate components
      from that wall.
  Lzimann:
  - rscadd: Bar stools are now constructable with metal!
  coiax:
  - rscadd: Ghosts are notified when someone arrives on the Arrivals Shuttle. This
      is independent of the announcement system, and the (F) link will follow the
      arrived person.
  - tweak: Slimes and aliens with custom names now retain those names when changing
      forms.
  kevinz000:
  - bugfix: Malf AI hacking an APC that is then destroyed will no longer bug the AI
  - bugfix: Being turned into a Revolutionary now stuns you for a short while.
  - bugfix: Kinetic Accelerators no longer drop their firing pin or cell when destroyed
      by lava
  phil235:
  - rscadd: Firelock assemblies can be reinforced with plasteel to construct heavy
      firelocks.
2016-06-12:
  Joan:
  - rscadd: Attacking a human you are pulling or have grabbed with a ratvarian spear
      will impale them, doing massive damage, stunning the target, and breaking the
      spear if they remain conscious after being attacked.
  - tweak: The Function Call verb is now an action button.
  Xhuis:
  - rscdel: While experimenting with floral genetic engineering, Nanotrasen botanists
      discovered an explosive variety of the cherry plant. Due to gross misuse, the
      genes used to produce this strain have been isolated and removed while Central
      Command decides how best to modify it.
  xxalpha:
  - rscadd: 'New wizard spell: Spacetime Distortion.'
  - rscadd: 3x1 grafitti
2016-06-13:
  Joan:
  - tweak: Sigils of Transgression will now only stun for about 5 seconds, from around
      10 seconds.
  - tweak: Sigils of Submission take about 5 seconds to convert a target, from around
      3 seconds, and will glow faintly.
  - rscadd: Sigils of any type can be attacked with an open hand to destroy them,
      instead of requiring harm intent. Servants still require harm intent to do so.
  Lati:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen has added one of their rare machine prototypes to cargo's selection.
      It might be valuable to research.
  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: You can now create living cake/cat hybrids through a slightly expensive
      crafting recipe. These "caks" are remarkably resilient, quickly regenerating
      any brute damage dealt, and can be attacked on harm intent to take a bite to
      be fed by a small amount. They serve as mobile sources of food and make great
      pets.
  - rscadd: If a brain occupied by a player is used in the crafting recipe for caks,
      that player then takes control of the cak!
2016-06-14:
  Joan:
  - tweak: The Gateway to the Celestial Derelict now takes exactly 5 minutes to successfully
      summon Ratvar and has 500 health, from 1000.
  - rscadd: You can now actually hit people adjacent to the Gateway; only the center
      of the Gateway can be attacked. The Gateway is also now dense, allowing you
      to more easily shoot at it.
  - rscadd: All Scripture in the Clockwork Slab's recital has a simple description.
  Razharas:
  - rscadd: Wiki now has the method of cultivating kudzu vines that was in game for
      over a year. https://tgstation13.org/wiki/Guide_to_hydroponics#Kudzu
  kevinz000:
  - tweak: Gravity Guns should no longer destroy local reality when set to attract
      and shot in an east cardinal direction. Added safety checks has slightly increased
      the cost of the gun's fabrication. Nanotrasen apologizes for the inconvenience.
  - bugfix: Gravity guns now have an inhand sprite.
2016-06-16:
  GunHog:
  - rscadd: In response to alarmingly high mining cyborg losses, Nanotrasen has equipped
      the units with an internal positioning beacon, as standard within the module.
  Joan:
  - rscadd: You can now strike a Tinkerer's Cache with a Clockwork Proselytizer to
      refill the Proselytizer from the global component cache.
  - tweak: The Clockwork Proselytizer requires slightly less alloy to convert windows
      and windoors.
  - tweak: Several clockwork objects have more useful descriptions, most notably including
      structures, which will show a general health level to non-servants and exact
      health to servants.
  - imageadd: The Clockwork Proselytizer has new, more appropriate inhands.
  - tweak: Invoking Inath-Neq, the Resonant Cogwheel, now gives total invulnerability
      to all servants in range for 15 seconds instead of buffing maximum health.
  - tweak: Impaling a target with a ratvarian spear no longer breaks the spear.
  - tweak: Judicial Markers(the things spawned from Ratvar's Flame, in turn spawned
      from a Judicial Visor) explode one second faster.
  - rscdel: Removed Dementia Doctrine, replacing it with an Application sigil.
  - rscadd: Adds the Sigil of Accession, the previously-mentioned Application sigil,
      which is much like a Sigil of Submission, except it isn't removed on converting
      un-mindshielded targets and will disappear after converting a mindshielded target.
  - tweak: Sigil of Submission is now a Script instead of a Driver; It's unlocked
      one tier up, so you have to rely on the Drivers you have until you get Scripts,
      instead of spamming both Driver sigils for free converts.
  - rscadd: To replace Sigil of Submission in the Driver tier; Added Taunting Tirade,
      which is a chanted scripture with a very fast invocation, which, on chanting,
      confuses, dizzies, and briefly stuns nearby non-servants and allows the invoker
      a brief time to relocate before continuing the chant.
  - rscadd: Ghosts can now see the Gateway to the Celestial Derelict's remaining time
      as a countdown.
  - tweak: Anima Fragments are now slightly slower if not at maximum health and no
      longer drop a soul vessel when destroyed.
  Quiltyquilty:
  - rscdel: Patches now hold only 40u.
  - rscdel: Patches in first aid kits now only contain 20u of chemicals.
  coiax:
  - rscadd: Polymorphed mobs now have the same name, and where possible, the same
      equipment as their previous form.

      decreased from 20 seconds to 16 seconds.
  - tweak: Charger holoparasite charge cooldown decreased from 5 seconds to 4 seconds.
  - tweak: Chaos holoparasite attack damage decreased from 10 to 7, range decreased
      from 10 to 7.
  - tweak: Lightning holoparasite attack damage increased from 5 to 7, chain damage
      increased by 33%.
  - rscdel: Clock cult scripture unlock now only counts humans and silicons.
  - rscadd: Servants of ratvar can now create cogscarab shells with a Script scripture.
      Adding a soul vessel to one will produce a small, drone-like being with an inbuilt
      proselytizer and tools.
  - imageadd: Clockwork mobs have their own speechbubble icons.
  - tweak: Invoking Sevtug now causes massive hallucinations, brain damage, confusion,
      and dizziness for all non-servant humans on the same zlevel as the invoker.
  - rscdel: Invoking Sevtug is no longer mind control. RIP mind control 2016-2016.
  - tweak: Clockwork slabs now produce a component every 50 seconds, from 40, Tinkerer's
      Caches now produce(if near a clockwork wall) a component every 35 seconds, from
      30.
  - experiment: 'Tinkerer''s daemons have a slightly higher cooldown for each component
      of the type they chose to produce that''s already in the cache: This is very
      slight, but it''ll add up if you have a lot of one component type and are trying
      to get more of it with daemons; 5 of a component type will add a second of delay.'
  Kor and Iamgoofball:
  - rscadd: Miners can now purchase fulton extraction packs.
  - rscadd: Miners can now purchase fulton medivac packs.
  - rscadd: Two new fulton related bundles are available for purchase with vouchers.
  Quiltyquilty:
  - rscadd: Beepsky now has his own home in the labor shuttle room.
  Wizard's Federation:
  - bugfix: We've fired the old Pope, who was actually an apprentice in disguise.
      We've a-pope-riately replaced him with a much more experienced magic user.
  - rscadd: Some less-then-sane people have been sighted forming mysterious cults
      in lieu of recent Pope sightings, lashing out at anyone who speaks ill of him.
  - bugfix: We've rejiggered our trans-dimensional rifts, and almost all cases of
      clergy members being flung into nothingness should be resolved.
  - bugfix: All members of the Space Wizard's Clergy have been appropriately warned
      about usage of skin-to-stone spells, and such there should be no more instances
      of permanent statueification.
  Xhuis:
  - tweak: Revenants have been renamed to umbras and have undergone some tweaks.
  coiax:
  - rscadd: Drones can hear robotic talk, but cannot communicate on it. AIs and cyborgs
      are encouraged to share information with station repair drones.
  - rscadd: Potted plants can now be ordered from cargo.
  - rscdel: AI turrets no longer fire at drones.
2016-06-20:

  incoming5643:
  - experiment: New abilities for some races!
  - rscadd: Skeletons (liches) and zombies now are much more susceptible to limb loss,
      but can also reattach lost limbs manually without surgery.
  - rscadd: Slimepeople can now lose their limbs, but also can regenerate them if
      they have the jelly for it. Additionally slimepeople will (involuntarily) lose
      limbs and convert them to slime jelly if they're extremely low on jelly.
  - rscadd: Zombies and slimepeople now have reversed toxic damage, what usually heals
      now hurts and what usually hurts now heals. Keep in mind that while you could
      for example heal with unstable mutagen, you'd still mutate. Beware of secondary
      effects! Drugs like antitoxin are especially dangerous to these races now since
      not only do they do toxin damage, but they remove other toxic chems before they
      can heal you. Be wary also of wide band healing drugs like omnizine.
  - rscadd: For slime people the above mechanic also adds/drains slime jelly. So yes
      inhaling plasma is now a valid way to build jelly (but you'll still suffocate
      if there's no oxygen).
  - rscadd: Pod people now mutate if shot with the mutation setting of the floral
      somatoray.
2016-06-22:

      causing them to become confused and unequip their current module.
  Joan:
  - rscdel: Those who do not serve Ratvar cannot understand His creations.
  - rscadd: You can now repair clockwork structures with a clockwork proselytizer.
      This is about a third as efficient as a mending motor, costing 2 liquified alloy
      to 1 health, and also about a third as fast.
  - tweak: Scarab proselytizers are more efficient and will reap more alloy from metal
      and plasteel.
  - rscadd: They can also directly convert rods to alloy.
  - tweak: Nuclear bombs will no longer explode the station if in space. Please be
      aware of this.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: You can now pick up potted plants.
  PKPenguin321:

  - rscadd: Drone shells can be ordered in Emergency supplies at Cargo.
2016-06-23:
  Joan:
  - tweak: Tinkerer's Caches generate components(when near clockwork walls) every
      minute and a half, from every 35 seconds. Clockwork Slabs generate components
      once per minute, from once per 50 seconds.
  - tweak: Spatial Gateway will last four seconds per invoker, instead of two per
      invoker.
  - rscdel: Clockwork floors now only heal toxin damage on servants of Ratvar.
  - rscdel: You can no longer place ocular wardens very close to other ocular wardens.
  - tweak: The Flame produced by a Judicial Visor is no longer an effective melee
      weapon and will trigger on all intents, not just harm intent.
  Wizard's Federation:
  - bugfix: Acolytes of Hades have revealed their true forms.
  - rscadd: We've discovered a way to traverse portals left behind by Hades, and have
      discovered a great treasure through it.
  - bugfix: Hades has undergone Anger Management classes, and should no longer remain
      wrathful for the duration of his visit.
  coiax:
  - rscadd: Changelings now evolve powers via the cellular emporium, which they can
      access via an action button.
  - rscadd: Due to budget cuts, the shuttle's hyperspace engines now create a visual
      distortion at their destination, a few seconds before arrival. Crewmembers are
      encouraged to use these "ripples" as an indication of where not to stand.
  - bugfix: Shuttles now only run over mobs in turfs they are moving into, rather
      than the entire rectangle.
  - rscadd: If you are an observer, you can click on transition edges of a Z-level
      in order to move as a mob would.
  - rscadd: Due to safety concerns, the Hyperfractal Gigashuttle now has some safety
      grilles to prevent accidental matter energising.
  coiax, incoming:
  - rscadd: Due to budget cuts, the builtin anti-orbit engines on the station have
      been removed. As such, expect the station to start orbiting the system again,
      and encounter an unpredictable stellar environment.
  - rscdel: All permanent structures (not on station, Centcom or lavaland) have been
      removed.
  - rscadd: All removed structures are now space ruins, and can be placed randomly
      in space ruin zlevels.
  - wip: The White Ship remains at its current location, but has lost any reliable
      landmarks near it. Its starting position will be made more random in a coming
      update.
  - rscadd: The Space Bar has a small atmos system added and a teleporter. Some other
      ruins have been cleaned up to not have atmos active turfs.
2016-06-24:
  Joan:
  - experiment: The Interdiction Lens has been reworked; instead of allowing you to

      are dead won't show up as charged.
  Joan:

      damage, block slightly more often, and have to go slightly further from their

  - rscadd: Item throwing now imparts the momentum of the user throwing. Throwing
      in the direction you are moving throws the item faster, throwing away from the

      with floor tiles less likely.
  XDTM:

      of Replicant Alloy.

  - rscadd: 'Badmins: Buildmode map generators have names in the list to select them,

      VERY sparingly, it deletes the block of the map and reloads it to roundstart.
      THIS CAN CAUSE ISSUES WITH MACHINES AND ATMOSPHERICS, SO DO NOT USE IT UNLESS
      YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO!
  - experiment: The reload station one tagged DO NOT USE shouldn't be used as it doesn't
      delete anything before loading, so if you use it you'll have two copies of things.
      That can result in a LOT of issues, so don't use it unless you're a codermin

  - experiment: Geis's "stun" restrains the target and prevents them from taking actions,
      but its duration is halved if the binding is not being pulled by a Servant.
  - wip: Using Geis on a target prevents you from taking actions other than attempting
      to pull the binding. If you are pulling the binding, you can dispel it at any

      with a slab, not just the initiator.

      decentralized research to prevent the hallways from becoming a free for all.

      all feedback and concerns on the forum so we can revise the system over the
      days, weeks, and months, to make this enjoyable for everyone. Heavily wanted
      are ideas of how to add more ways of generating points.
  - balance: You can get techweb points by setting off bombs with an active science
      doppler array listening. The bombs have to have a theoretical radius far above
      maxcap to make a difference. You can only go up, not down, in radius, so you
      can't get 6 times the points with 6 TTVs. The algorithm is exponentially/logarithmically
      scaled to prevent "world destroyer" bombs from instantly finishing research.

      balancing in symptoms.
  - rscadd: Starlight Condensation heals toxin damage if you're in space using starlight
      as a catalyst. Being up to two tiles away also works, as long as you can still
      see it, but slower.
  - rscadd: Toxolysis (level 7) rapidly cleanses all chemicals from the body, with
      no exception.
  - rscadd: 'Cellular Molding heals brute damage depending on your body temperature:
      the higher the temperature, the faster the healing. Requires above-average temperature
      to activate, and the speed heavily increases while on fire.'
  - rscadd: Regenerative Coma (level 8) causes the virus to send you into a deep coma
      when you are heavily damaged (>70 brute+burn damage). While you are unconscious,
      either from the virus or from other sources, the virus will heal both brute
      and burn damage fairly quickly. Sleeping also works, but at reduced speed.
  - rscadd: Tissue Hydration heals burn damage if you are wet (negative fire stacks)
      or if you have water in your bloodstream.
  - rscadd: Plasma Fixation (level 8) stabilizes temperature and heals burns while

      from the poisoning effects of plasma.
  - rscadd: Radioactive Resonance gives a mild constant brute and burn healing while
      irradiated. The healing becomes more intense if you reach higher levels of radiation,
      but is still less than the alternatives.
  - rscadd: Metabolic Boost (level 7) doubles the rate at which you process chemicals,
      good and bad, but also increases hunger tenfold.

      (usually after 10 minutes) or power is restored.
  - rscadd: You can override emergency light functionality from an APC. You can also
      click on individual lights as a cyborg or AI to override them individually.

  - rscadd: Holding two directions at the same time will now move you diagonally.
      This works with the arrow keys, wasd, and the numpad.
  - tweak: Moving diagonally takes twice as long as moving a cardinal direction.
  - bugfix: You can use control to turn using wasd and the numpad instead of just
      the arrow keys.
  - rscdel: 'Some old non-hotkey mode behaviors, especially in relation to chatbox
      interaction, can''t be kept with the new system. Of key note: You can''t type
      while walking. This is due to limitations of byond and the work necessary to
      overcome it is better done as another overhaul allowing custom controls.'

  - rscdel: Reverted changes in 3d sound system that tripled the distance that sound
      would carry.

  XDTM:
  - rscadd: 'Brain damage has been completely reworked! remove: Brain damage now no
      longer simply makes you dumb. Although most of its effects have been shifted
      into a brain trauma.'
  - rscadd: Every time you take brain damage, there's a chance you'll suffer a brain
      trauma. There are many variations of brain traumas, split in mild, severe, and
      special.
  - rscadd: Mild brain traumas are the easiest to get, can be lightly to moderately
      annoying, and can be cured with mannitol and time.
  - rscadd: Severe brain traumas are much rarer and require extensive brain damage
      before you have a chance to get them; they are usually very debilitating. Unlike
      mild traumas, they require surgery to cure. A new surgery procedure has been
      added for this, the aptly named Brain Surgery. It can also heal minor traumas.
  - rscadd: 'Special brain traumas are rarely gained in place of Severe traumas: they
      are either complex or beneficial. However, they are also even easier to cure
      than mild traumas, which means that keeping these will usually mean keeping
      a mild trauma along with it.'
  - rscadd: Mobs can only naturally have one mild trauma and one severe or special
      trauma.
  - balance: Brain damage will now kill and ruin the brain if it goes above 200. If
      it somehow goes above 400, the brain will melt and be destroyed completely.
  - balance: Many brain-damaging effects have been given a damage cap, making them
      non-lethal.
  - rscdel: The Unintelligible mutation has been removed and made into a brain trauma.
  - rscdel: Brain damage no longer makes using machines a living hell.
  - rscadd: Abductors give minor traumas to people they experiment on.

      Anything they say is heard over the Hierophant network, and they can issue commands
      by middle-clicking themselves or different turfs.
  - rscadd: The Eminence also has a single-use mass recall that warps all servants
      to the Ark chamber.
  - rscadd: Added traps, triggers, and brass filaments to link them. They can all
      be constructed from brass sheets, and do different things and trigger in different
      ways. Current traps include the brass skewer and steam vent, and triggers include
      the pressure sensor, lever, and repeater.
  - rscadd: The Eminence can activate trap triggers by clicking on them!
  - rscadd: Servants can deconstruct traps instantly with a wrench.

      yellow scriptures are for construction, red for offense, blue for defense, and
      purple for niche.
  - balance: Servants now spawn with a PDA and black shoes to make disguise more feasible.
  - balance: The Eminence can superheat up to 20 clockwork walls at a time. Superheated
      walls are immune to hulk and mech punches, but can still be broken conventionally.

      taking an extra second less.
  - bugfix: Poly no longer continually undergoes binary fission when Ratvar is in
      range.
  - code_imp: The global records alert for servants will no longer display info that

      benefit from colder temps when you're overheating even in full EVA/hardsuit

2018-01-27:
  Anonmare:

  Robustin:
  - rscadd: Blood magic. The next generation of talismans - you can create 2 spells
      without a rune, up to 5 with a rune of empowerment. Preparing spells without
      a rune will cost a significant amount of blood. Every talisman has been rebalanced
      for its spell form. With a few exceptions, blood magic exists as a "touch" spell
      that is very similar in behavior/appearance to the wizard touch spells.
  - rscadd: New UI system for cultists.
  - rscdel: Removed talismans, Talisman Creation Rune replaced by Rune of Empowerment.
      Supply talisman has been replaced by a ritual dagger and 10 runed metal.

  - tweak: Only the cult master can forge Bastard swords now, regular cultists can
      get a mirror shield.
  - rscadd: 'The mirror shield, it blocks, it reflects, it creates illusions, and
      an incredible throwing weapon! The mirror shield also bears a unique weakness:
      Shotgun slugs, .357 rounds, and other high damage projectiles will instantly
      shatter it and briefly stun the holder.'
  - balance: Nar'sien Bolas will not longer ensnare cultists and non-cultists will
      ensnare themselves when attempting to use them. The bolas are now comparable
      in effectiveness with reinforced bolas.
  - rscadd: Rune of Spirits. This merges the Spirit Sight and Manifest Ghost rune.
      The user will now choose which effect when invoking.
  - rscadd: The Spirit Sight function has received several major improvements, allowing
      the ghost to commune with the cult and mark objects similar how the cult master
      can. The user has a unique appearance while ghosted and manifested cult ghosts
      can see ghosts as well - allowing their summoner to lead them from the spirit
      realm.
  - balance: The Form Barrier rune will now last significantly longer and examining
      the rune as a cultist will tell you how long it will remain.
  - rscadd: The Apocalypse Rune. Replaces the EMP runes. Has a fixed invoker requirement
      and added usage limitations.  It scales depending on the crew's strength relative
      to the cult. Effect includes a massive EMP, unique hallucination for non-cultists,
      and if the cult is doing poorly, certain events. The rune can only occur in
      the Nar-Sie ritual sites and will prevent Nar-Sie from being summoned there
      in the future.

  - balance: The hallucination spell now has multiple charges.
  - tweak: The teleport spell can now be used on other adjacent cultists.

      which lets you choose between summoning a Ritual Dagger or Combat Gear (same
      loadout that Summon Armor used to provide).
  - balance: Standard cult robes now have -10 melee and -10 laser armor.
  - balance: The "Construction" spell will now convert airlocks into cult airlocks
      and cyborgs (after ~10 seconds) into constructs. The airlock is the most fragile
      in the game, with reduced integrity, armor, and render it vulnerable to most
      attacks. Cyborg "reconstruction" will be accompanied by an obvious effect/sound.
  - rscadd: Blood Rites. This spell allows you to absorb blood from your surroundings
      or adjacent non-cultists. You can use the blood rites as a convenient heal (self-healing
      is significantly more costly though) or you can try to gather large quantities
      of blood for unique and powerful relics.
  - rscadd: Blood spear, a fragile but robust spear with a special recall ability
  - rscadd: Blood bolts, the cultist's version of arcane barrage. The bolts will infuse
      cultists with unholy water and damage anything else.
  - rscadd: Blood beam, the ultimate blood rite. After a channeling period it will
      fire 12 powerful beams across a long distance, piercing almost any surface (except
      blessed turf), and damaging all non-cult life caught in the beam.
  - tweak: All cult structures now generate significantly less light.
  - balance: Pylons will now heal constructs faster and restore slightly more blood
      than before.
  - balance: Cult floors are now highly resistant to atmospheric changes.
  - bugfix: Unholy water will now splash victims properly.

      at healing brute, and deals slightly more damage to non-cultists, the splash

      new abilities. remove: Vessels are not antagonists. Assimilation does not convert
      crew in any way.'
  - rscadd: Assimilated crewmembers can escape this nightmare by either getting a
      mindshield implant or by dying. Mindshielding vessels will reveal the identity

  - rscadd: Nothing is stopping Hosts from working together, but as their hives grow,
      so does the incentive to backstab. At 8 vessels, Hosts can probe the minds of
      crew and discover the identity of any other Hosts who have assimilated them,
      and at 18, they can steal every single vessel from a captured enemy Host.

      objectives have been removed from the mode.'
  - tweak: Powers have been reorganized and are now unlocked in batches every five

      phases due to each batch affecting a specific area of the host's ability.

      and must be strengthened by using Network Invasion. Each time a host is detected

      random vessels into antagonists with a single, customizable objective.
  - rscadd: 'Circadian Shift is a late-game power that sends everybody in sight to

      especially at lower hive sizes.
  - balance: 'Induce Panic and Circadian Shift can affect silicons but no longer affect

      way as volume pumps.
  - rscadd: As well, hitting a volume pump with a multitool will overclock it, allowing
      it to move gases to higher than normal pressures at the cost of leaking some
      of the contents.

      and bring the assigned target dead or alive to the designated drop off. Call

      uplink.

  - rscadd: Lobectomy! Not lobotomy, but cuts out a damaged lung lobe to make its
      performance passable. Restores a lung to working order if it was too damaged
      to work before, but can only be done once. The lobectomy step has a 95% chance
      of success, so use some form of sterilizer to ensure you don't accidentally
      get blood inside your patient's lungs!
  - rscadd: Coronary Bypass! Restores a heart to working order if it was too damaged
      to work before, but can only be done once. Both incising the heart and grafting

      and massive amounts of bleeding- so be sure to work with ideal conditions, proper
      tools, and sterilizer!

  - balance: Defib timer has been extended to 15 minutes! Now cloning has a decent
      alternative. All you have to do is heal or replace failing organs e.g. mannitol
