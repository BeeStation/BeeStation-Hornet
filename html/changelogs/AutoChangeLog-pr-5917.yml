changes:
  - rscadd: Added a new Access code for the Research Servers, separating the server
      room access and the RD's office access, which on roundstart is available only
      to the Captain and the Research director.
  - tweak: Adjusted all the maps to have the right access to the server room, where
      it's now needed either the RD's office access or the Server room access.
  - rscdel: Removed the Apothecary access, as it was used nowhere and was conflicting
      with the Request console's announcement system.
