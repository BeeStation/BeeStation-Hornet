changes:
  - rscadd: New heretic path - Path of Void- it specializes in being extremely stealthy.
  - rscadd: Large scale heretic revamp!
  - rscadd: The Codex Cicatrix is no longer a roundstart heretic item. Research is
      handled through an action button. Rune drawing is done by using a writing tool
      with Mansus Grasp active in your offhand. The actual Codex is an unlockable
      ritual item now.
  - rscadd: The Living Heart is no longer a roundstart heretic item - their actual
      heart now becomes their Living Heart, and it makes a sound when triggered. Losing
      your heart (being disemboweled) will require you to do a ritual to regain it.
  - rscadd: The Hereic Antag UI has been overhauled, and now hosts much of their mechanics
      as well as providing some helpful tips for newer players.
  - rscadd: Most heretic spells now require a focus to cast. All heretics can make
      a basic focus necklace, and some heretic equipment also functions as a focus.
      (Credit to Imaginos for the focus sprite!)
  - rscadd: Heretics now passively gain +1 influence every 20 minutes.
  - rscadd: Heretic sacrificing has been reworked. You can now sacrifice people who
      are in soft crit or weaker. Sacrificing someone heals them, cuffs them, and
      teleports them to the SHADOW REALM, where they must dodge a barrage of hands
      to survive. Survive long enough and you return without memory - die, and your
      body will be thrown back.
  - rscadd: Heretics now have a few new rituals, including the Ritual of Knowledge,
      a randomly generated ritual that awards knowledge points.
  - rscadd: Heretic ascension now has a few requirements - you must complete your
      objectives assigned to you prior to learning the final ritual, and all the final
      rituals have been changed a bit!
  - tweak: Used heretic influences can now be removed with a Anomaly Neutralizers.
  - balance: Some heretic rituals are now limited in the amount they can make. You
      can only have up to 2 heretic blades crafted at once (3 if you are Path of Flesh).
  - balance: The Lord of the Night has been buffed to be a little scarier. Did you
      know the Lord of the Night can eat arms to regain body parts and heal?
  - balance: Buffed some heretic summons - mostly their health pools.
  - balance: Nerfed the heretic's Mask of Madness. It can no longer infinite stam-crit
      you.
  - balance: Nerfed the heretic's ash mark.
  - balance: 'Nerfed a bunch of on-hit-heretic-blade effects. Many effects only apply
      on mark detonation now: Void blade silence, flesh blade wounds, ash blade gasp
      cooldown refund.'
  - bugfix: Fixed quite a few bugs and unintended behaviors with heretic code.
  - refactor: Refactored and improved much of Heretic code. Improved the file structure
      dramatically.
  - admin: The heretic's traitor panel has been beefed up a bit.
  - refactor: Refactored cult rune inscribing into a component
  - refactor: Refactored null rod rune clearing into a component
  - code_imp: Rust is now a component
  - refactor: refactor almost all of the rust heretic atom procs
  - rscadd: Wirebrush for advanced rust removal
  - rscadd: 'A new heretic node to replace rust wave: entropic plume.'
  - rscadd: A small rune visual effects appears 70% of the time when a tile is rusted.
  - rscdel: Removed the rust wave node.
  - bugfix: The ash man and rust walker nodes now link to the correct nodes.
  - rscadd: IPCs who roll heretic now become human with the user's Backup Human Name.
  - rscadd: Raw Prophets can now toggle their sight range with the Change Sight Range
      action
  - tweak: Heretics can no longer hijack the Emergency Shuttle
  - bugfix: Heretic Smugglers (latejoin heretics) actually spawn influences
  - bugfix: Fixes a few potential issues with heretic rituals.
  - code_imp: Adds proper stack support to heretic rituals. Also allows for more specific
      "ritual failure" feedback.
  - code_imp: Added an isstack helper
  - tweak: heretic sacrifices will drop their legcuffs before entering the minigame
      (bolas, bear traps)
  - balance: 'Heretic: The Amber Focus is now fireproof.'
  - balance: 'Heretic: The Eldritch Medallion (thermal vision necklace) is now fireproof,
      acid proof, and works as a focus.'
  - balance: 'Heretic: The Void Cloak can carry more things in its pocket, including
      various ritual components (organs, bodyparts, flowers), small heretic items,
      and a singular sickly blade. It also functions as a focus while the hood is
      down.'
  - balance: 'Heretic: Mawed Crucible potions are now small sized (down from normal).'
  - tweak: Heretic rituals overhauled slightly. You now pick from a list of all your
      rituals when invoking a rune to select what ritual you want to do.
  - bugfix: Minor fixes for the Heretic's Living Heart ritual. Cybernetic organs are
      now properly detected.
  - bugfix: Similarly, you cannot feed the mawed crucible cybernetic organs.
