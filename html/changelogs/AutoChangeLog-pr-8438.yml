changes:
  - balance: Decreased the snowball effect of fear build-up from (stress x10)% to
      (stress x5)%. Your stress levels build up faster with each fainting now, which
      leads to a higher chance of a heartattack
  - bugfix: You wont faint immediately after waking up from a faint caused by a phobia
  - bugfix: The message for fainting from a phobia will actually be visible for the
      one fainting now
