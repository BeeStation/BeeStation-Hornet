changes:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen VIP Expense Account Budget has been added. VIPs will be paid
      from this budget directly from Nanotrasen rather than the station budget.
  - tweak: Station heads can't change VIP's payment anymore. (but they can't give
      bonus to them also.)
  - tweak: VIP bank accounts are all fixated to Nanotrasen VIP budget department,
      and changing department will not change their assigned department.
  - tweak: VIP payment is now 2000 credits, and roundstarts with 10000 credits
  - tweak: VIP mail from cargo is now yellow
  - bugfix: cargo ordering app through a tablet will not accept improper id card
  - tweak: department change lock feature - even if you change your department, some
      jobs (VIP, Captain, HoS) don't have a newly changed department as your bank
      account paying department.
