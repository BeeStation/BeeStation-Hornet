changes:
  - rscadd: modsuits
  - tweak: all ERT have been converted to use modsuits
  - tweak: all antagonists that had hardsuits (Nukies, Spacewizard, Uplink Traitors)
      have been converted to use modsuits
  - rscadd: adds a loader modsuit for cargo to use. It is not spaceproof and has very
      little module support, but is good for hauling crates
  - code_imp: adds unit test to confirm all outfits apply correctly
  - rscdel: deletes antagonist, ERT, and head of staff hardsuits
  - refactor: refactored wizard casting to check a clothing flag, instead of a var
  - tweak: captain's backpack now fits on both MODsuits & suit storage slots
  - bugfix: fixes spellcards targeting. Revamps lockon component.
  - rscadd: adds infiltrator kit, a modsuit that hides your species mutantorgans like
      wings and antennae, with superior armor, normal runspeed and silent footsteps,
      in exchange for no spaceproofing.
  - refactor: refactors ninja gear to all use modsuit modules
