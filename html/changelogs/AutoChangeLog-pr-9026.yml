changes:
  - rscadd: Added the bluespace capsule, available through applied bluespace research.
      Press the button and toss the capsule and watch as it expands into a tall storage
      device. Close it to shrink it back into a pocket-sized capsule. Has the same
      capacity as a normal crate but cannot hold bulky items or most mobs (Tiny mobs
      like mice will fit inside).
  - rscadd: Added the ability to pick up most bots such as beepsky and medibots by
      powering them down (requires ID access) and then dragging them onto yourself.
      Mulebots and ED209 are too large to be carried and do not work with this functionality.
  - tweak: All bots now have a 4-8 second startup sequence when powered on to prevent
      very sudden surprise attacks utilizing bot deployments.
  - code_imp: 'Adds a new object type: "/obj/item/deployable" for items which can
      be toggled between a deployable form that is carried around and "deployed" form
      that is interactable within the environment'
  - refactor: Refactored body bags and roller beds to be subtypes of deployable mentioned
      above. There should be no functional difference in how these items behave.
  - refactor: Refactored barrier grenades to be a subtype of deployable - these are
      no longer grenades and are instead collapsible barriers now. The barriers may
      only be dismantled after being unlocked by swiping an ID with security clearance.
  - tweak: The amount of security barriers available at roundstart and within cargo
      orders has been roughly doubled because they are now always deployed one.
  - tweak: Sandbags and wooden barricades can now be recollected as well by dragging
      them onto the user's sprite. Damage sustained to these barricades affects their
      return yield when picked up.
