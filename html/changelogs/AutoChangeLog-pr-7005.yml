changes:
  - bugfix: Fixed a conjugation issue for examining unknowns or plural gendered mobs
      with special limbs
  - bugfix: Prosthetic Limbs showing up as right/left arm/leg in examine instead of
      robotic right/left arm/leg
  - bugfix: Attack messages now mention the zone affected rather than the name of
      the limb affected
