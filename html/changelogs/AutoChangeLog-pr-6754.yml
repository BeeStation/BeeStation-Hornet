changes:
  - rscadd: Adds PTSD - a slightly modified version of the miniature energy gun with
      3 fewer disabler shots per charge, but the ability to fully recharge itself
      in 120 seconds.
  - balance: All heads of staff can now pick up PTSD at the start of the round by
      checking their lockers, except for the HoS who starts with PTSD whether they
      want it or not.
  - balance: The HoS and Captain no longer have roundstart access to a full size energy
      gun due to acquiring PTSD. They do still have their unique weapons.
  - balance: To make up for the increased firepower, the telescopic baton is no longer
      deals stamina damage, except when targeting arms. It is still effective for
      tripping and disarming, but not locking someone down in place indefinitely.
