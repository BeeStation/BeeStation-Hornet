changes:
  - rscadd: Added a visual effect for dropping items from your inventory or hands
  - rscadd: Increased the animation time of the pickup effect, to make it less of
      a snapshot. Did some other things to it to hopefully make it look nicer
  - rscadd: dropped items will now be randomly pixelshifted around
