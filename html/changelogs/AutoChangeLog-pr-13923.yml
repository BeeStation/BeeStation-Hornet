changes:
  - bugfix: When performing pierce protection checks, simplified targeting will now
      prefer zones that do not have pierce protection.
  - bugfix: Pierce protection is now performed after selecting a target zone, correcting
      bruise pack/ointment behaviour that either incorrect allowed or rejected healing
      through armour.
  - tweak: Simplified targeting bodyzone selection now shows if an area of the body
      is pierce proof.
  - tweak: Increases contrast for simplified targeting medical alert icons.
