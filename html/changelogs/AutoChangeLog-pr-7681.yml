changes:
  - balance: Dynamic will not spawn midround traitors, obsessed, or heretics at lowpop
      if over 15% of the living crew is antag.
  - balance: Dynamic's threat will now scale the center of the threat curve down by
      one threat for each player under 30 players readied at roundstart.
  - bugfix: Fixed dynamic simulation capping threat based on actual roundstart players
      ready instead of simulated players ready.
