changes:
  - tweak: The exploding rubber ducky now has a dramatic delay before exploding so
      the victim can truly appreciate the humor of their situation. This delay does
      not allow the victim any opportunity to move away from the explosion.
  - bugfix: Mines now have to be smartmines to use smartmine logic. Explosive ducks
      (and other mines) are now 100% more dangerous for security personnel who were
      previously immune to funny.
