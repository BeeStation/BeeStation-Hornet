changes:
  - tweak: traitor items inside of a box will now get illegal tech bitflag, but there
      are some items that won't get it. If you want to make it sure, hover your mouse
      cursor on the item name in uplink. a tooltip will appear if it has illegal tech
      or not.
  - tweak: roundend report now tells how effectively a traitor used their TC with
      sales
  - refactor: refactored uplink code
  - balance: some items (i.e. money case) from uplink are no longer illegal tech.
      basically suspicious boxes.
