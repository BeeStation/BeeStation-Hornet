changes:
  - rscadd: adds cogbars, a way for players to see others preforming actions
  - refactor: refactored CPR. You no longer have to click the patient for every pump.
      The action will repeat, slowly at first until gaining enough speed when your
      character starts getting in-tune with the Beegee's song.
  - refactor: refactored the way progressbars display on very large mobs, now they
      will be centre'd like expected
  - refactor: do_afters and numerous timed_action_flags
  - bugfix: npcs do not make progressbars, saves processing
