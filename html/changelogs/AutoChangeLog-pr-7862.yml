changes:
  - rscadd: a new reagent container type - Chemical bag (max 200u). printable from
      ChemMaster. Currently, this does not have many usages - not drinkable, and not
      insertable into ChemMaster back.(but grindable) only usable for IV drip.
  - tweak: blood packs are grindable
  - code_imp: adds a bitflag that allows a grinder can grind a reagent container,
      and related proc 'is_grindable()'
  - code_imp: new variable label_name that is used to display specific string without
      suffix like bottle, pill, patch
