changes:
  - refactor: Software Downloader program UI revamp
  - tweak: The NtOS home screen has been updated with disk and ID eject buttons.
  - rscadd: Added support for modular PC expansion bays, or hardware bays designed
      to be used by nonessential hardware. Devices have a limited number of bays (tablets
      less than others).
  - balance: The AI card slot, printer, and APC-siphoning recharger are now expansion
      bay hardware.
  - balance: The modular PC atmos scanner now requires a new expansion bay hardware
      item - the sensor package. Certain shift-start tablets have been adjusted to
      reflect this.
  - refactor: Modular PC card readers have been split -- The primary ID card reader,
      which comes pre-installed on nearly all devices, and a secondary ID card reader
      which is an expansion bay hardware and will need to be purchased separately.
      Certain shift-start devices have a secondary reader pre-installed.
  - bugfix: Buying a tablet from the Laptop/Tablet vendor, and paying extra for the
      mini-printer, will now attach the correct printer rather than attempt to stuff
      a laptop printer into a tablet and silently fail but still take your cash.
  - rscadd: Added icons for all modular computer programs
  - rscadd: Supermatter Monitoring will now send notifications if the app is closed
      with a supermatter selected, and the selected supermatter starts delaminating.
  - bugfix: Modular computers can now be attacked with non-help intent.
  - code_imp: Fixes a runtime error with recharger examine text if the inserted item's
      power cell is null
  - bugfix: Fixed a runtime with ID modification program when the second ID slot is
      missing.
  - bugfix: ID modification program now follows the standard for ID reading and requires
      you to insert your card.
  - tweak: Primary and secondary ID card slots in ModPCs have separate names to make
      it easier to differentiate.
