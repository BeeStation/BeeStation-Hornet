changes:
  - bugfix: no more temporary blindness when spawning in!
  - refactor: refactored blindness code to be less redundant and poorly applied.
  - bugfix: no more perma-blindness if blindness is improperly applied to you! Update_stat
      should actually do its job now.
  - code_imp: removed duplicate method 'blind_eye', replaced in favor of 'adjust_blindness'
  - rscadd: The Blind and Unconcious will now have monochromatic vision, because they
      don't know what colors are. This change is made in anticipation of adding blind-vision
      in the near-future.
