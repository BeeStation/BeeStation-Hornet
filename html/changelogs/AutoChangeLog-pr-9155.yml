changes:
  - balance: Syndicate teleporter has been reworked. It will no longer teleport through
      solid walls but will be more effective at knocking down targets in a combat
      scenario, as it will knock down any targets passed through during a teleport.
      It can be used to jump through windows without being shocked. The price has
      been reduced from 8 TC to 7.
