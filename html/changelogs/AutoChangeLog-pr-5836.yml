changes:
  - rscadd: examining an item now tells its blocking ability, blocking arc, and the
      force string you see on a mouse over
  - balance: shields can now block projectiles again
  - balance: blocking has been nerfed on many items
  - balance: blocking itself has had a minor nerf- blocking an attack delays your
      next action as if you have hit with a melee attack
