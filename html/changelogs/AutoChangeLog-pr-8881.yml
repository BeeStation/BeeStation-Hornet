changes:
  - code_imp: made mimic code less bad
  - tweak: mimic mobs (especially, animating venders) will become back to how it was.
      For Brand Intelligence event, dead mimics will become a destroyed vending machine
  - tweak: Brand Intelligence targeted vendors no longer explode when the event happens.
      These will become a stronger version instead. (i.e. more HP, more damage, etc)
      Otherwise, vending machine mobs have slightly less HP.
  - tweak: mimic crate will eat items on where it is spawned - including important
      items like a nuke disk. Still, nuke disk is trackable, and dead mimic will let
      things out. (Admins can use this to contain stuff into a mimic crate by spawning
      that mob - but items should be placed on it.)
