  - rscadd: New bounty has been added - Profession manuscript. To write a manuscript,
      find an empty "manuscript" book first. You can get them from random book shelves
      with 5% chance, or get one from cargo book ordering, and then click the book
      with your pen. Antagonist can write a manuscript in any job (but everyone has
      15 minutes cooldown to write one). There are always assistant bounty, and random
      3 jobs.
  - rscadd: a tiny helper code that cargo shuttle only needs short seconds to move
      when debugging
