changes:
  - bugfix: All action mutations now properly take energy chromosomes (which reduce
      ability cooldowns) rather than synchronizer chromosomes.
  - bugfix: Cat Claws and Strengthened Wings now properly accept power chromosomes
      â€” they already had code that took the power chromosome into account, but couldn't
      actually have said chromosome applied to them.
  - rscadd: Shock touch, cryokinesis, and chameleon can now accept power chromosomes
      to improve their respective powers.
  - rscadd: Acid hands can take a power or sync chromosome, to increase the acid power
      or decrease the blood loss respectively.
  - soundadd: Cat Claws now changes your attack sound to slashing noises, similar
      to moths or lizards.
  - tweak: Upgrading a DNA scanner will accordingly update any cooldowns (joker and
      injector) for linked genetics consoles.
  - rscadd: Inserting a genetics diskette into a genetics console will now actually
      mark any mutations on said disk as discovered. This likely won't change anything
      during actual rounds, but this will be useful during debugging or perhaps adminbus.
  - tweak: You won't waste shock touch charges accidentally clicking on the floor
      or a wall anymore.
  - code_imp: Cleaned up the code of a lot of mutations quite a bit.
