changes:
  - balance: Repairing cyborgs now takes half as long per tick, and repairing burnt
      wires also restores for twice as much on top of this. 2x speed for brute and
      4x speed for burn repairs overall.
  - balance: Cyborg self-repair module is much better at doing its job and much less
      power hungry. It is still greatly outclassed by getting someone else to do repairs,
      but should be seen as a worthwhile upgrade to install now. The module also has
      sound effects now.
  - balance: Cyborgs now slow down gradually as they receive damage
  - balance: Cyborgs can no longer be stunlocked by flashes - they will be stunned
      once for five seconds (down from seven) and then immune to further stuns for
      30 seconds (indicated by flashing lights).
  - tweak: Successfully opening the cover of a cyborg which is flash stunned will
      refresh the stun timer to five seconds the first time it happens.
  - tweak: All silicons take burn damage from EMPs now instead of brute
  - tweak: Cyborg health HUDs will now more accurately represent their current HP,
      only blinking red when they are critically close to breaking down instead of
      at half health.
  - bugfix: Fixed an exploitable oversight that allowed cyborgs to equip and use modules
      in slots that are supposed to be deactivated
  - bugfix: fixed a calculation error regarding the stunning and throwing of buckled
      mobs when a cyborg is hit with an EMP.
