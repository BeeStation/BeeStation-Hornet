changes:
  - refactor: each chemical now has bitflag for synthesizable, rng, crew goal stuff.
      some bitflags are not used yet, but they're going to be used in future update.
      'NotSynth' flag doesn't involve in RNG chemical anymore except for when they
      are used to filter as blacklist.
  - tweak: random chemical system is now structured into 3 types - general, fun, botany.
      random chemical is now more dynamic up to its type. (And added 2 types that
      would be used in the future)
  - rscadd: random chem general type - used in abductor gland, clown car, etc. can
      be dangerous, but not frustrating stuff. (was meant to be used in scrub event.)
  - rscadd: random chem fun type - used in maint pill or necropolis bottle. most ingame
      chemicals including admin/traitor stuff excluding some lame stuff(like Water).
      Risk yourself.
  - rscadd: random chem botany type - used in botany strange seed. it will even use
      a wider list than before - which means more gimmicky.
  - rscadd: random chem basic chemical - to be used in future botany rework.
  - rscadd: random chem basic drink - to be used in future botany rework.
  - tweak: necropolis random reagent bottle's name is now "ancient bottle of unknown
      reagent"
  - tweak: the way choosing random chem for crew objective is changed. crew objectives
      that give you a random chemical goal doesn't pick an unachievable objective
      anymore (i.e. Changeling Adrenaline) This uses the same random chem system above,
      but a bit separately named to avoid causing any confusion.
  - rscadd: random chem goal - chemist drug type (now with more medicines)
  - rscadd: random chem goal - chemist bloodstream type
  - rscadd: random chem goal - botanist harvest type (if they're not in the standard
      plants, you should do botanical-chemistry. build your own recipe.)
  - rscadd: random chem goal - bartender servings type (only implemented in its codewise.)
