  Tacolizard:
  - rscadd: Admins can now set a message/warning when they delay the round end, to
      be shown to anyone who tries to reboot the world.
  Tacolizard and Cyberboss:
  - rscadd: Added two new organs, the liver and stomach. Without them, you won't metabolize
      chemicals.
  - rscadd: The liver is responsible for processing all chemicals except nutrients.
      If your liver is removed, you will be unable to metabolize any drugs and will
      slowly die of toxin damage.
  - rscadd: Drinking too much alcohol or having too many toxins in you will damage
      your liver, if it becomes too damaged, it will undergo liver failure and you
      will slowly die of toxin damage. Your liver naturally heals a small amount of
      its damage. However, it doesn't heal enough to offset stronger alcohols or large
      amounts of toxins, at least until they are metabolized out of your body.
  - rscadd: to conduct a liver transplant, inject corazone into the patient. Corazone
      will prevent the patient from taking damage due to either not having a liver
      or undergoing liver failure. Corazone will metabolize out of the patient quickly,
      so at least 50u is recommended.
  - rscadd: The stomach is responsible for metabolizing nutrients. Without a stomach,
      you will be unable to get fat, but you will also be unable to process any nutrients,
      meaning you will eventually starve to death.

      now bonuses for the base Vomit symptom.

      YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO!
  - experiment: The reload station one tagged DO NOT USE shouldn't be used as it doesn't
      delete anything before loading, so if you use it you'll have two copies of things.
      That can result in a LOT of issues, so don't use it unless you're a codermin
      and know what you're doing/abusing!
