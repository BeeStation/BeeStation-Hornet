  Skylar Lineman, your local R&D moonlighter:

      generated when there is atleast one research server properly cooled, powered,
      and online.

      decentralized research to prevent the hallways from becoming a free for all.

  - balance: You shouldn't expect balance as this is the initial merge. Please put
      all feedback and concerns on the forum so we can revise the system over the
      days, weeks, and months, to make this enjoyable for everyone. Heavily wanted
      are ideas of how to add more ways of generating points.
  - balance: You can get techweb points by setting off bombs with an active science
      doppler array listening. The bombs have to have a theoretical radius far above
      maxcap to make a difference. You can only go up, not down, in radius, so you
      can't get 6 times the points with 6 TTVs. The algorithm is exponentially/logarithmically
      scaled to prevent "world destroyer" bombs from instantly finishing research.
  SpaceManiac:
  - bugfix: HUDs from mechs and helmets no longer conflict with HUD glasses and no
      longer inappropriately remove implanted HUDs.

      balancing in symptoms.
  - rscadd: Starlight Condensation heals toxin damage if you're in space using starlight
      as a catalyst. Being up to two tiles away also works, as long as you can still
      see it, but slower.
  - rscadd: Toxolysis (level 7) rapidly cleanses all chemicals from the body, with
      no exception.
  - rscadd: 'Cellular Molding heals brute damage depending on your body temperature:
      the higher the temperature, the faster the healing. Requires above-average temperature
      to activate, and the speed heavily increases while on fire.'
  - rscadd: Regenerative Coma (level 8) causes the virus to send you into a deep coma
      when you are heavily damaged (>70 brute+burn damage). While you are unconscious,
      either from the virus or from other sources, the virus will heal both brute
      and burn damage fairly quickly. Sleeping also works, but at reduced speed.
  - rscadd: Tissue Hydration heals burn damage if you are wet (negative fire stacks)
      or if you have water in your bloodstream.
