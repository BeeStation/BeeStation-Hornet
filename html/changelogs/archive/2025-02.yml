  : - refactor: Converted TGUI backend from Inferno to React. Minimal user-facing
        changes.

  Rukofamicom:
  - balance: swarmers may no longer ventcrawl, and will also spawn in a random location
      instead of at the gateway. Without ventcrawling, the event as a whole should
      be more of a stand-off and defense than a bunch of constantly scurrying roaches.

  - tweak: swarmer melee attacks now do 35 stamina damage
  - tweak: swarmer replication now costs 20 resources

  - tweak: swarmer traps now trigger in an AoE when destroyed and their visuals and
      sound effects have been updated. The AoE has a greater effect on cyborgs than
      previously as well, due to their immunity to stamina damage.
  - tweak: swarmer objective text has been slightly modified to clarify they can attack
      crew as long as they don't harm them
  marshmellow10, MarkusLarsson421, Therealdoooc213, Tsar-Salat:

      night vision.
  - rscdel: Removed 2 antagonist focused rituals
  - rscdel: Removed need for being shadow person to chose this sect

  PigeonVerde322, Rkz, Kylerace, ArcaneMusic, zxaber:
  - refactor: refactors machine and power code to cut down on processing costs
  - bugfix: fixes non-processing machines failing to consume power
  - bugfix: fixes rechargers and inducers allowing for effectively infinite power.
      Now, what is used to charge these cells is exactly what can be expended from
      them.
  - tweak: rechargers now suck power directly from surplus energy on the powergrid,
      as opposed to the Equipment part of an APC. This is to prevent the former fix
      from making every single recharger on the station a mini-energy siphon.
  - rscadd: examining any machinery will now tell if it's powered or not.
  RDS88:
  - tweak: Custom AI laws are now more readable on the end-of-round report. You don't

  Rukofamicom:
  - bugfix: Lazarus injectors will now work as originally intended on non-sentient
      mobs. This means that lazarus revived mobs will be passive to crew and other
      passive mobs, friendly toward the person that revived them, and actively hostile
      to other hostile mobs.
  - tweak: Lazarus injectors will continue to work as they always have on already
      sentient mobs, and the intent is now clearly stated in-game to those mobs when
      they are revived. Lazarus is not a brainwashing tool and does not force loyalty
      or obedience in the creatures it revives if they are smart enough to think for
      themselves
  - tweak: Lazarus injectors now have a 10% chance of making any mob revived by one
      sentient, with its own free will to choose violence, servitude or anything in
      between.
  - tweak: The examine text of lazarus injectors now includes a warning that creatures
      with "especially strong wills" are known to turn against the user. This is in
      reference to both already sentient mobs and the newly added chance to create
      a sentient mob.
  - tweak: Lazarus now takes ten seconds to take effect, with the mob it is used on
      jittering a bit before actually being revived.
  XeonMations:
  - bugfix: Advanced wirebrushes no longer ignore radiation protection before dealing
      damage.

        but admins can now varedit items to attack faster/slower.
    - code_imp: unit tests reagent container transfer amounts
    - code_imp: unit tests attacking people
    - balance: Using Jaunts will conceal your runechat for their duration.
    - code_imp: passed IS_HERETIC through the proc, rather than checking everytime
        you used a heretic spell. Less runtimes.
    - bugfix: cutting wires while a TGUI menu is open will no longer shock you and
        bypass shock protection
    - tweak: cleaned up airlock prying code. Nightmare blades are now crowbars and
        fulfill tool_acts, they still can break stuff by being on combat mode though.

      spy glasses kit, and chameleon mask for voice changing. They do not have a second
      clip for their gun.
  - balance: The clown assassination target now spawns with a lube flower instead
      of water flower, and also knows taeclowndo thanks to their fancy shoes.
  - tweak: Mechs are now affected by swarmer traps, however they will only be stunned
      for three seconds instead of ten.
  - bugfix: Adjusts swarmer abilities so that they are available in accordance to
      the recently updated costs
