      walls around the camera. On the other hand, cameras with an xray upgrade let

      whenever they're on blobs near a node or the core.

      by brute damage in melee.

      the 'blob' faction, such as blobbernauts and spores.

      choice by using it in hand. Each one has different strengths and drawbacks.

      twice the power of a stage 3 singulo with maxed collectors without any balls,

  - experiment: The time needed to complete most tablecrafting recipes has been cut
      in half to make tablecrafting less annoying to use.

      brain can't be put into a robot, they can still be put inside a brainless humanoid
      corpse and cloned, but deffibing the corpse always fails (can't revive someone
      with a brain beaten to a pulp).
