  - experiment: Redid how objectives are assigned, they're now a lot more random in
      terms of what you can get.
  Incoming5643:
  - tweak: Removed gender restrictions from socks.
  Joan:
  - rscdel: Storage Blobs are gone; they were effectively a waste of resources, as
      there are more or less no points at which you should need them, unless you were
      winning excessively hard.
  - rscdel: Blobs can no longer burst early; instead, the button gives some early
      help and serves to indicate you're a blob.
  - wip: Blobbernauts now poll candidates instead of grabbing a candidate immediately.
      The poll is 5 seconds, so that there's no significant pause between making a
      blobbernaut and it doing stuff.
  - rscadd: Blobbernaut creation replaces Storage Blob creation on the blob HUD.
  - tweak: Overmind communication is now much larger and easier to see, and blob mobs,

      drifting as the user moving.
  - tweak: This does not apply to the target of a long action if that target isn't
      you. Pulling something while space drifting and working on it intentionally
      won't work.

      to a far-off research facility owned by Nanotrasen. The signal was sent out
      in hopes of someone competent receiving it, unfortunately, your station was
