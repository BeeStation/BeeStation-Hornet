      impacts security officers who will find their belts have 2 additional slots.
  - tweak: Most security personnel now spawn with a loaded belt instead of a loose
      baton, cuffs and flash.
  - tweak: Detectives now spawn with a 5-slot "utility" belt that holds some of their
      tools that were previously loose. This belt is actually just a renamed fanny

  - code_imp: cleaned up some anomaly codes, and separated the file into multiple
      dm
  - rscadd: Sanity Disruptor Anomaly! This will appear at +30 pops with a little bit
      high chance. Sadly, this doesn't have a core. The anomaly will pulse to make
      you stunned, blinded, and a little bit hallucinated. Although it's almost harmless.
  - bugfix: Fixed the original insanity pulse artifact can't send more pulses when
      it reaches the end of the world map where the item exists. Also, fixed a pulse
      triggers the effect on a mob twice as it included a turf twice.

      will sort a chat in deadchat group.'
