      also improving as much code as I could along the way.
  - bugfix: Dullahans only hear speech through their head (not sounds, sadly, someone
      else would have to tell me how to do that because I otherwise really wouldn't
      know how to do it in a sane way), they speak through their head, runechat-included.
  - bugfix: When you spawn a Dullahan, you're set to look through the Dullahan's eyes

      that they were unable to do before.
  - bugfix: Dullahans can now succumb in hardcrit by whispering, as intended. This
      potentially fixes other species that worked similarly not being able to succumb,
      like abductors.
  - bugfix: When switching from Dullahans to a different species, your old head will
      no longer stay behind.
