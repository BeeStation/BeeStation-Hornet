  - rscadd: New craftable a7.62, shotgun, 9mm, 10mm, .38, and .357 ammo types. Lever
      action rifle, craftable pipe rifle and pipe pistol, craftable pipe SMG and magazines.

      on freesound.org
  - imageadd: Sprites for new ammo types, guns and accessories. Custom in-hand sprites

      by OceanFish1.

      high-power ammo (buckshot, slugs, most tech shells). No danger with improv ammo

      have higher recoil across the board as a result. Slightly lowers Improv shotgun's

      unwielded spread to bring it in line with the changes from high speed gun accuracy

      when crafted.

      round, and must be manually cycled before use.
  - tweak: Improvised weapons require an igniter, and a welder to construct now.
  - tweak: The admin-only trait "NICE_SHOT" now allows the user to cycle PUMP and
      TWO_STEP bolt firearms with a single hand, instead of requiring both.
  - refactor: Changes mosin/boltaction rifle code to be a new bolt type instead of
      bespoke code for the rifle parent type.
