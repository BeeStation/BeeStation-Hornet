      or a wall anymore.
  - code_imp: Cleaned up the code of a lot of mutations quite a bit.

  RKz, Rohesie:
  - code_imp: unconsciousness is now a trait, cleaned up its usage in mobility and
      stat, which should make it perform a lot quicker and generate less edge-cases
  - bugfix: being woken up from unconsciousness should always clear trauma-induced
      monochromatic vision

      but using the sleep verb will now heal you less than involuntary unconciousness,
