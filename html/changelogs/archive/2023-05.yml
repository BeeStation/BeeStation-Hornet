      when toggling internals.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that prevented toggling of internals via the stripping menu
      if the mob only had a breathing tube.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that allowed two mobs to breathe from the same air tank after
      exchanging it between them.
  EvilDragonfiend:
  - rscadd: Orbit panel tracks antag team rather than individual antag name (i.e.
      ERTs, Abductors)
  - bugfix: job icon in orbit panel no longer looks horrible
  - tweak: some antagonists/teams will display some different name in orbit panel
  - tweak: eldritch horrors are now tracked in antag category in orbit panel
  PowerfulBacon,CydiaLamiales:
  - rscadd: Exploration hardsuits now have a HUD which points them towards research
      disks and item objectives.

  - bugfix: Fixes some atoms_movable related harddels
  - balance: mechs no longer block sight
  RKz, TiviPlus, xzaber:
  - bugfix: silicons will actually QDEL their law datum when they get destroyed
  - admin: if an AI's law datum gets deleted for spaghetti reasons, a stack_trace
      will be sent letting you be able to determine when, (and probably) how it occurred
  Rukofamicom:
  - balance: Repairing cyborgs now takes half as long per tick, and repairing burnt
      wires also restores for twice as much on top of this. 2x speed for brute and
      4x speed for burn repairs overall.
  - balance: Cyborg self-repair module is much better at doing its job and much less
      power hungry. It is still greatly outclassed by getting someone else to do repairs,
      but should be seen as a worthwhile upgrade to install now. The module also has
      sound effects now.
  - balance: Cyborgs now slow down gradually as they receive damage
  - balance: Cyborgs can no longer be stunlocked by flashes - they will be stunned
      once for five seconds (down from seven) and then immune to further stuns for
      30 seconds (indicated by flashing lights).
  - tweak: Successfully opening the cover of a cyborg which is flash stunned will
      refresh the stun timer to five seconds the first time it happens.
  - tweak: All silicons take burn damage from EMPs now instead of brute
  - tweak: Cyborg health HUDs will now more accurately represent their current HP,
      only blinking red when they are critically close to breaking down instead of
      at half health.
  - bugfix: Fixed an exploitable oversight that allowed cyborgs to equip and use modules
      in slots that are supposed to be deactivated
  - bugfix: fixed a calculation error regarding the stunning and throwing of buckled
      mobs when a cyborg is hit with an EMP.

2023-05-14:
  Absolucy:
  - balance: Blood and Clock Cult now have a strict minimum population requirement
      of 24.
  - balance: Nanite chambers (including public chambers) are now upgradable! Upgraded
      manipulators result in more "starting" nanites, and upgraded micro-lasers will
      speed up the chamber.
  CydiaLamiales:
  - tweak: Added a murderbone objective check to shuttle hijacking
  EvilDragonfiend:
  - tweak: having monitoring nanites can make you trackable by pinpointer. simple/carbon
      mobs with monitoring nanites are now trackable by pinpointer (as long as they
      have mind...) Jammer will disable this.
  - rscadd: pinpointer is now trackable z-levels as long as those z-levels are in
      the same group (i.e. multi-floored station). Orange bar will appear if your
      target is within the same type z-level.
  - imageadd: some pinpointer indicating sprites
  - refactor: better pinpointer code
  - rscadd: ChemMaster now says which amount chem units it can hold.

      with 200 max units)
  HowToLoLu:
  - bugfix: Fixed a runtime involving Plasmamen outfits given by jobs
  Ivniinvi, EdgeLordExe, Melbert, Imaginos, SpaceManiac, ChungusGamer666, AnturK, ZephyrTFA, coiax, Krysonism:
  - rscadd: New heretic path - Path of Void- it specializes in being extremely stealthy.
  - rscadd: Large scale heretic revamp!
  - rscadd: The Codex Cicatrix is no longer a roundstart heretic item. Research is
      handled through an action button. Rune drawing is done by using a writing tool
      with Mansus Grasp active in your offhand. The actual Codex is an unlockable
      ritual item now.
  - rscadd: The Living Heart is no longer a roundstart heretic item - their actual
      heart now becomes their Living Heart, and it makes a sound when triggered. Losing
      your heart (being disemboweled) will require you to do a ritual to regain it.
  - rscadd: The Hereic Antag UI has been overhauled, and now hosts much of their mechanics
      as well as providing some helpful tips for newer players.
  - rscadd: Most heretic spells now require a focus to cast. All heretics can make
      a basic focus necklace, and some heretic equipment also functions as a focus.
      (Credit to Imaginos for the focus sprite!)
  - rscadd: Heretics now passively gain +1 influence every 20 minutes.
  - rscadd: Heretic sacrificing has been reworked. You can now sacrifice people who
      are in soft crit or weaker. Sacrificing someone heals them, cuffs them, and
      teleports them to the SHADOW REALM, where they must dodge a barrage of hands
      to survive. Survive long enough and you return without memory - die, and your
      body will be thrown back.
  - rscadd: Heretics now have a few new rituals, including the Ritual of Knowledge,
      a randomly generated ritual that awards knowledge points.
  - rscadd: Heretic ascension now has a few requirements - you must complete your
      objectives assigned to you prior to learning the final ritual, and all the final
      rituals have been changed a bit!
  - tweak: Used heretic influences can now be removed with a Anomaly Neutralizers.
  - balance: Some heretic rituals are now limited in the amount they can make. You
      can only have up to 2 heretic blades crafted at once (3 if you are Path of Flesh).
  - balance: The Lord of the Night has been buffed to be a little scarier. Did you
      know the Lord of the Night can eat arms to regain body parts and heal?
  - balance: Buffed some heretic summons - mostly their health pools.
  - balance: Nerfed the heretic's Mask of Madness. It can no longer infinite stam-crit
      you.
  - balance: Nerfed the heretic's ash mark.
  - balance: 'Nerfed a bunch of on-hit-heretic-blade effects. Many effects only apply
      on mark detonation now: Void blade silence, flesh blade wounds, ash blade gasp
      cooldown refund.'
  - bugfix: Fixed quite a few bugs and unintended behaviors with heretic code.

      action

  - bugfix: Heretic Smugglers (latejoin heretics) actually spawn influences
  - bugfix: Fixes a few potential issues with heretic rituals.
  - code_imp: Adds proper stack support to heretic rituals. Also allows for more specific
      "ritual failure" feedback.
  - code_imp: Added an isstack helper
  - tweak: heretic sacrifices will drop their legcuffs before entering the minigame
      (bolas, bear traps)
  - balance: 'Heretic: The Amber Focus is now fireproof.'
  - balance: 'Heretic: The Eldritch Medallion (thermal vision necklace) is now fireproof,
      acid proof, and works as a focus.'
  - balance: 'Heretic: The Void Cloak can carry more things in its pocket, including
      various ritual components (organs, bodyparts, flowers), small heretic items,
      and a singular sickly blade. It also functions as a focus while the hood is
      down.'
  - balance: 'Heretic: Mawed Crucible potions are now small sized (down from normal).'
  - tweak: Heretic rituals overhauled slightly. You now pick from a list of all your
      rituals when invoking a rune to select what ritual you want to do.
  - bugfix: Minor fixes for the Heretic's Living Heart ritual. Cybernetic organs are
      now properly detected.
  - bugfix: Similarly, you cannot feed the mawed crucible cybernetic organs.
  Rkz, Time-Green, SteelSlayer, floyd, Qustinuus, ArcaneDefence, FlowerCuco:
  - rscadd: Food storage! Hide some glass in the captains cake! Fuck his digestive
      system!!! (Not really, accidental consumption isnt active w/o wounds or stomach
      refactor, so It doesnt do anything yet lmao)
  - rscadd: Bread, Cake and Spaghetti to Newfood
  - rscadd: dunkable element. Dunk yo nuggies in the ketchup.
  - rscadd: some smaller foods can now be eaten whilst on the run! (This ONLY applies
      to newfood items thus far!)
  - rscadd: converted edible component to work with newfood
  - rscdel: oldfood for Bread, Cake and Spaghetti
  - tweak: edited a few messed up values
  - tweak: food trash is sensible now. Finishing stuff like cake will actually spawn
      a plate rubbish. Instead of you eating the plate, fatso, perhaps properly dispose
      of it!
  - bugfix: Wildly STUPID item weights. Candycorn and cakes are no longer the SAME
      size
2023-05-15:
  Absolucy:
  - rscadd: Slime crossbreeds can be scanned for 750 discovery points each.
  - tweak: Each color slime can be discovery scanned, rather than just scanning a
      slime once.
  DarnTheMarn:
  - rscdel: Removed ACCESS_AUX_BASE, ACCESS_RESEARCH, ACCESS_ENGINE, ACCESS_MINING,
      ACCESS_MEDICAL, ACCESS_CONSTRUCTION, ACCESS_MAILSORTING, ACCESS_MINERAL_STOREROOM
      from HOS access list

      Fland, Glow, and Meta.
  Rukofamicom:

  uomo91, Elli-Skala:
  - tweak: Sergeant Araneus is now a proper subtype
2023-05-17:
  Absolucy:
  - rscadd: Added upgraded blood filtering surgeries! These are obtained through the
      same research as its wound-tending counterparts, and work faster while also
      removing toxin damage.
  - balance: Very slightly reduced the amount of reagents that blood filtering purges
      (by around 2%), to compensate for the increased speed offered by the upgraded
      surgeries.

    - rscadd: Added a system of forms and the ability to print them
    - bugfix: Hints in bureaucracy forms
    - rscadd: Added new VOID stamp
    - bugfix: Photocopier paperforms
    - rscadd: Fax Machine
    - bugfix: Fixes faxes playing the "fax_contain" animation and makes it actually

      update.
  ShizCalev, ATHATH, OnlineGirlfriend, Iamgoofball, The0bserver, Stewydeadmike, TripleZeta and RKz:
  - rscadd: A special interaction for trying to put a mushroom on an Arnold pizza
      has been added.
  - rscadd: Arnold pizza references its source material more accurately/often now.
  - rscadd: Chefs can now cook moffins! Yaaay moffins! Check the pastries subsection
      of the crafting menu to make some! Cutting up clothes and bedsheets can get
      you started!

      out your local Megaseed Vendor today!

      trap.
  - code_imp: made mimic code less bad
  - tweak: mimic mobs (especially, animating venders) will become back to how it was.
      For Brand Intelligence event, dead mimics will become a destroyed vending machine
  - tweak: Brand Intelligence targeted vendors no longer explode when the event happens.
      These will become a stronger version instead. (i.e. more HP, more damage, etc)
      Otherwise, vending machine mobs have slightly less HP.
  - tweak: mimic crate will eat items on where it is spawned - including important
      items like a nuke disk. Still, nuke disk is trackable, and dead mimic will let
      things out. (Admins can use this to contain stuff into a mimic crate by spawning
      that mob - but items should be placed on it.)
  - code_imp: cleaned up some bad coding
  - refactor: refactored access checking system. checking access is slightly faster
  - admin: admin can bypass no-respawn with respawn verb
  - code_imp: toxin naming that is used to plasma is now changed to plasma (i.e. canister/toxins

      change the chameleon card inside of PDA as well.

  RKz, Rohesie. TiviPlus:

  - bugfix: blockers block what they should, not what they shouldnt (like phasing
      mechs getting stuck on railings and windows???)
  RKz, timberpoes, Ninjanomnom, CoffeeKat, DoctorSquishy:
  - bugfix: Fixed runtimes in the air subsystem, where deleted objects were still
      processed.
2023-05-20:
  Absolucy:
  - bugfix: Advanced/experimental blood filtering now actually requires the appropriate
      tech.
  - bugfix: Max-tier blood filtering surgery actually heals toxin now.
  - rscadd: Added a description to all variations of blood filtering surgery.
  RKz, Jacquerel:
  - rscadd: New foodtype, GORE. Split from GROSS, GORE foodtype will be replacing
      it where the food in particular resembles a corpse or organ. GROSS should only
      apply to inedible or rotting foods.
  - balance: All butchered player species are considered to be gore, only preferred
      by Lizards, Felinids, and Flies. If you like the taste of your fellow crew,
      prepare accordingly.
  - balance: Moved food preferences around to make more sense with the current system.
      Nothing drastic, but species liked foods should be much more immersive in general.
  Rukofamicom:
  - rscadd: Adds a new type of reagent, metabolites. Metabolites are produced as a
      byproduct of any reagent with a metabolite set and can be used to trace what
      kinds of reagents someone has been exposed to at least somewhat recently. For
      now metabolites are only implemented for Bicaridine, Kelotane, Antitoxin, Tricordrazine,
      Styptic Powder and Silver Sulfadiazine.
  - balance: Bicaridine, Kelotane, Antitoxin and Tricordrazine are equally effective
      regardless of current HP again, instead having their effects wane as metabolites
      build up. They will always be useful, but will never be the only thing you need
      to treat more severe injuries.
  - tweak: Bruise packs and ointment now utilize reagent code to heal instead of directly
      healing. Due to overdosing concerns, they heal for half as much per application,
      but come with twice as many applications per stack to compensate.
  - balance: Because they now properly utilize medicine, ointments and bruise packs
      are now very painful! Players will find they are unable to subject themselves
      to this pain if they try to apply more than one in quick succession. Seek help
      from others if you need multiple applications!
  - tweak: Gauze can now heal injured simplemobs just like bruise packs.
  itsmeow:
  - bugfix: Martial arts granting books (karate scroll, CQC manual, etc) no longer
      break permanently if you interrupt it last second.

      area or has the holy effect applied to it
  - code_imp: Replaced checks for the holy effects with is_holy checks
  - tweak: Made all holy roles be able to see blessed tiles rather than just the chaplain
      (This means Holy Undead will be able to see them too)
  PestoVerde322:
  - bugfix: finally addressed the floating lattices not connecting to open turfs
  Tsar-Salat:
  - bugfix: broken blackberry cake icon_states, leading to invisible cake. Invisible
      cake couldnt be eaten, very sad.

      paramedics, roboticists, and brig physicians for 12 TC. It grants the user perfect
      surgery knowledge, allowing them to do almost any surgery, anywhere, quickly
      and free of mistakes. It is however, NOT available to either nuclear operatives
      or incursion members.
