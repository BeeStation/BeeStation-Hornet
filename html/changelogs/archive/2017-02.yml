  MrPerson:
  - experiment: 'Ion storms have several new additions:'

      the AI well without its precious law 1 to protect your sorry ass.
  - rscadd: 10% chance that, instead of adding a random law, it will instead replace
      one of the AI's existing core or supplied laws with the ion law. Otherwise,
      it adds the generated law as normal. There's still a 100% chance of getting
      a generated ion law.

  Kor, Jordie0608 and Tokiko1:
  - rscadd: Singularity containment has been replaced on box, meta, and delta with
