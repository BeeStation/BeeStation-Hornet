  Absolucy:
  - bugfix: Fixed admins seeing LOOC message senders as themselves rather the actual
      sender
  AgentCitrus, kit-katz:
  - rscadd: 'A visual upgrade for the supermatter: a displacement effect that worsens
      with damage, particles, a new delamination animation, and a subtle distortion
      effect left behind after a delamination'
  Rukofamicom:
  - bugfix: Revenants can no longer phase shift inside of dense objects! There was

  XeonMations, Dakae:
  - rscadd: Sentient monkey helmets, orderable from cargo

2023-08-02:
  PowerfulBacon:
  - balance: Reworks peppersprays and replaces them with the peppercloud deployer.
      This deploys a 3x3 cloud in front of the user which slows down anybody entering
      it, and will provide the normal pepperspray effect if they do not have cloud
      protection.
  - balance: You now move slowly inside of clouds.
  mystery3525:
  - rscadd: Logs for medical records, better format for security records logging
  - rscadd: Cooldown for biogenerator
2023-08-03:
  RKz, JJRCop, vuonojenmustaturska:
  - code_imp: kills arbitrary stasis wrapper proc and turns it into a define. Scrubs
      stasis from update_mobility. Eeks out a tiny bit of responsiveness compared
      to before.
  - tweak: stasis now supports multiple sources
  itsmeow:

2023-08-04:

  - tweak: Updated Delta medbay with feedback
  HowToLoLu:

      mind transfers, death, and disconnection/ghosting. Note that if you do lose
      connection you immediately lose control of the monkey.'
  - tweak: Stasis Beds can now be rotated by using a wrench while no-one is buckled
      to it and the maintenance panel is open.
  - bugfix: Beds now properly rotate the mob buckled to them. No more waking up on
      the wrong side of the bed.
  PowerfulBacon:
  - bugfix: Fixes some internal dynamic calculations, fixes dynamic simulations, fixes
      default dynamic server config.
  - bugfix: Fixes ethereal lighting and luminescent eyes.
  RKz, LemonInTheDark:
  - server: adds load testing macros, letting you simulate load, without the perils
      of live sage.
  itsmeow:
  - tweak: The SM now has a max positive gas composition accumulation of 5% per tick.
      This should reduce SM instability, but from testing it does not appear to fix
      the notorious "SM delam bug".
  - bugfix: The SM's power will not update when it is not supposed to.
  - bugfix: Fixed double parsing of gas strings.
2023-08-06:

2023-08-07:

  - bugfix: Fix 'false' Observe targets that would blank your screen or crash you

  Penwin0:
  - bugfix: Control click grabs are now affected by blocking, as their normal counterparts

      Portals will have an animation upon expiring rather than instantly disappearing.
  - bugfix: The hand teleporter will no longer open entry portals inside windows and
      airlocks
  - balance: Armour now stacks compoundly rather than additively. 2 sets of 50% armour
      will result in a total armour rating of 75% rather than 100%.
  - refactor: Refactors the code for armour penetration.
  - balance: Armour now has a maximum of 75% protection when coming from combat sources
      (Radsuits won't be capped at 75% protection).
  - balance: When the amount of armour a player has exceeds 50, additional armour
      will increase the armour however it will have a diminishing returns effect.
      This maps [50, Infinity] -> [50, 75] in a way such that adding more armour is
      always better for you and is guaranteed to result in an improved defense, but
      having infinite armour will only give you a total protection rating of 75%.
  itsmeow:
  - code_imp: Optimized autoname camera init, saving 88ms init on MetaStation.
  - code_imp: Reverted some verb optimizations, fixing verbs not getting added properly
2023-08-08:

2023-08-09:
  Absolucy:
  - rscadd: Added a search bar to the morph stomach UI.
  - rscadd: Morphs can now digest nutritious food to recover small amounts of health,
      however this healing is capped - a morph can only recover up to 20% of its health
      over the course of 2.5 minutes by digesting food.
  - tweak: Being husked by morph digestion is now considered a burn husk, meaning
      that synthflesh or rezadone can fix morph digestion victims.
  HowToLoLu:
  - bugfix: Dense objects can no longer be hidden under the floor, and will now produce
      a runtime when attempted.
2023-08-10:

    - tweak: PDA Theme can now be customized per-character.
    - tweak: Failed job selection now defaults to "Return to lobby" instead of "Be
        random job"
    - tweak: TGUI Dropdowns now have improved UX experience, and exist outside of
        the object they are within, instead existing above other UI elements. This
        means they cannot cause windows to scroll by overflowing, for example.
    - tweak: You can now select preferences to be randomized only when you are an
        antagonist
    - tweak: Per-character antagonist preferences can now be toggled globally, with
        per-character prefs only affecting if it's set to off.

  Absolucy:

      just deadlock the potion forever.

      or AFK will just tell you to try again later.
