      sactioned the dark path of lichdom. Beware of the powerful lich who hides his
      phylactery well, for he is immortal!
  - rscadd: The trick to defeating liches is to destroy either their body or their
      phylactery item before they can ressurect to it. The more a lich is slain the
      longer it will take him to make use of his phylactery and the more likely the
      crew is to catch him during a vunerable moment.
  - rscremove: Due to the addition of proper liching, skeletons as a choosable race
      from magic mirrors has been discontinued. My apologies to the powergamers. A

      of exosuit technology, from the Ripley APLU design to even experimental Phazon
      units. Simply upload your AI to the exosuit's internal computer via the InteliCard
      device. Per safety regulations, the exosuit must have maintenance protocols

      away and leaving behind glimmering residue as evidence of their demise.

      is used for all the remaining calculations instead of Armour (Eg: 80 Melee -
      15 AP = 65 Melee).'
  - rscadd: The Ninja's Energy Katana has 15 AP, Xenomorphs have an inbuilt AP of
      10.

      of their environment...

  - rscadd: The Sleeping Carp clan has made its presence known on Space Station 13.
