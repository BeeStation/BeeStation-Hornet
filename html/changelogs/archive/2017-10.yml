  Xhuis:
  - balance: Clockwork marauders now move more slowly below 40% health.
  - balance: Instead of a 40% chance (or more) chance to block projectiles, clockwork
      marauders now have three fixed 100% blocks; after using those three, they cannot
      block anymore without avoiding projectiles for ten seconds. This number increases
      to four if war is declared.
  - balance: Projectiles that deal no damage DO reduce marauders' shield health. Use
      disabler shots to open them up, then use lasers to go for the kill!

  - bugfix: You can no longer stack infinitely many stargazers on one tile.

  - spellcheck: This changelog has been updated and so read it again if you are interested
      in doing assmos.
  - rscadd: Atmospherics has been massively expanded including new gases.
  - rscadd: These new gases include Brown Gas, Pluoxium, Stimulum, Hyper-Noblium and
      Tritium.
  - rscadd: Brown Gas is acidic to breath, but mildly stimulation.
  - rscadd: Stimulum is more stimulating and much safer.
  - rscadd: Pluoxium is a non-reactive form of oxygen that delivers more oxygen into
      the bloodstream.
  - rscadd: Hyper-Noblium is an extremely noble gas, and stops gases from reacting.
  - rscadd: Tritium is radioactive and flammable.
  - rscadd: New reactions have also been added to create these gases.
  - rscadd: 'Tritium formation: Heat large amounts of oxygen with plasma. Make sure
      you have a filter ready and setup!'
  - rscadd: Fusion has been reintroduced. Plasma will fuse when heated to a high thermal
      energy with Tritium as a catalyst. Make sure to manage the waste products.
  - rscadd: 'Brown Gas formation: Heat Oxygen and Nitrogen.'
  - rscadd: 'BZ fixation: Heat Tritium and Plasma.'
  - rscadd: 'Stimulum formation: Heated Tritium, Plasma, BZ and Brown Gas.'
  - rscadd: 'Hyper-Noblium condensation: Needs Nitrogen and Tritium at a super high
      heat. Cools rapidly.'
  - rscadd: Pluoxium is unable to be formed.
  - rscdel: Freon has been removed. Use cold nitrogen for your SME problems now.
