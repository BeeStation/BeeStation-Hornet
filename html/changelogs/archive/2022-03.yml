  EvilDragonfiend:
  - refactor: Change to the cloning console and machine codes for error returns
  - bugfix: Cloning console TG window is now automatically updated when you trigger
      something.
  - tweak: Cloning console now tells which error you have failed to clone at.
  - tweak: Cloning console now properly lets you know that you can't clone a presaved
      person. It has always been so, but it has not warned you.
  - bugfix: Cloning record id is now reliably saved based on your name and mind, which
      fixes the record conflicts.
  - bugfix: Cloning console displays and accepts data in cloning diskettes properly,
      but remember that the clonable data becomes outdated once you clone them.
  - bugfix: Cloning console now can track the presaved person's health status.

      it on by variable edit. (Note that Autoclone has not ever been working, ever.)

      your brain into that body will make you lose them. This is likely a bug due

      trick will not work.
  - bugfix: Experimental cloner will properly work now and they can save data records
      now.

      than just allowing all ghosts to come in. (*a clone being catatonic means no
      ghost wanted the role.)

      as a human. Don't harass them.
