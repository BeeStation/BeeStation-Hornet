      now able to choose three positive quirks, even if they take no negative quirks.
      Nothing increases or decreases this amount, and negative quirks exist only for
      those who wish to actually interact with them as part of their character.

      chugging if you want that whiskey to numb the pain.

      have all been moved to neutral traits
