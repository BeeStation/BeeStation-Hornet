  - balance: Quirks no longer require balancing of good and bad. All characters are
      now able to choose three positive quirks, even if they take no negative quirks.
      Nothing increases or decreases this amount, and negative quirks exist only for
      those who wish to actually interact with them as part of their character.
  - tweak: Drunken Resilience may no longer be combined with Light Drinker, get to
      chugging if you want that whiskey to numb the pain.
  - tweak: Alcohol tolerance, light drinker, plushie lover, musician and spiritual
      have all been moved to neutral traits
  wikimody:
  - bugfix: Welding a damaged wall now heals it's values rather than only it's appearance
  - bugfix: Rclicking untiled floors no longer reinforces them, as it overrode the
      behavior of Rclicking with iron sheets to build girders
