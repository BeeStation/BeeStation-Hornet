  Rukofamicom:
  - balance: Cyborgs are no longer stunned by EMP and Flashes at all. They are also
      no longer immune to chain flashing due to the lack of stun
  - rscadd: Added a new status effect called "Malfunction" which is applied to cyborgs
      when they are hit with EMP or Flash. This status effect is now what causes the
      flashing red error lights, as well as triggering a slowdown for 30 seconds.
      Additionally the malfunction status makes cyborgs especially weak to emag, enabling
      the device to work even if the cover is closed.
  - balance: Successfully emagging an AI shell now stuns the shell for an extended
      period of time instead of simply resetting the module and signing your own death
      warrant.
  - tweak: Emagging a cyborg that is not affected by malfunction is unchanged, but
      specifically attempting to emag a cyborg with an already unlocked, but still
      closed cover, now tells the user they need to open the cover instead of simply
      doing nothing.
  - tweak: Being hit with an EMP as silicon now does twice as much burn damage now,
      40 for heavy EMP, 20 for light EMP
  - tweak: Being hit with an EMP as cyborg also scrambles all of your currently selected
      modules to random ones, scrambles the lock state of your cover, and has a 25%
      chance to cause your cover to fly open.
  - bugfix: Fixed an issilicon() check that needed to be an iscyborg() check, preventing
      potential runtimes. It's a good thing nobody has ever tried to flash an AI.

      / runechat awareness.
  - bugfix: Shapeshifting plays nicer with holoparasites.
  - bugfix: Being polymorphed from a xeno to a non-xeno correctly makes you a non-xeno
  - refactor: Refactored shapeshifting, the shapeshift holder is now a status effect
      instead of an object.
