  - balance: Handcuff RNG has been removed. It is no longer possible to randomly break
      out of cuffs sooner than the full timer, and messages about attempted escapes
      now happen every ten attempts
  - tweak: Dragging players which are prone (whether by choice or because they are
      unable to stand) is now much slower. Fireman carry or use roller bed or other
      similar item to move someone faster if they are unable or unwilling to stand.
  - rscadd: Handcuffed players may now severely injure one of their arms to break
      out of cuffs quickly, dealing 50 damage to a random arm or completely dismembering
      it if they are a race that is easily delimbed. Bear in mind that this option
      may not be wise to utilize depending on the circumstances you're in.

      them
