  Isaac:
  - bugfix: Modsuit defibrillator can be dual-wielded again
  Rukofamicom:
  - balance: Handcuff RNG has been removed. It is no longer possible to randomly break
      out of cuffs sooner than the full timer, and messages about attempted escapes
      now happen every ten attempts
  - tweak: Dragging players which are prone (whether by choice or because they are
      unable to stand) is now much slower. Fireman carry or use roller bed or other
      similar item to move someone faster if they are unable or unwilling to stand.
  - rscadd: Handcuffed players may now severely injure one of their arms to break
      out of cuffs quickly, dealing 50 damage to a random arm or completely dismembering
      it if they are a race that is easily delimbed. Bear in mind that this option
      may not be wise to utilize depending on the circumstances you're in.
  - bugfix: You now stop trying to break out of handcuffs if someone else removes
      them
  Schoolboy215:
  - rscadd: Alt+clicking on the map in a shuttle clears target and thrust
  Tsar-Salat:
  - refactor: splits legs and arms into grandchildren. (bodypart/l_arm is now bodypart/arm/left,
      etcetera)
  - tweak: changed TGUI genderpicker to use pronouns
  - code_imp: cleaned up some TGUI
  - code_imp: updated player worn state procs
  mrmanlikesbt:
  - config: adjusted the nuclear operative and blood cult team size formula
