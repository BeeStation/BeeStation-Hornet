  Marshmellow105:
  - rscdel: removed maltodexterin and microplastics
  Rukofamicom:
  - balance: Handcuff RNG has been removed. It is no longer possible to randomly break
      out of cuffs sooner than the full timer, and messages about attempted escapes
      now happen every ten attempts
  - tweak: Dragging players which are prone (whether by choice or because they are
      unable to stand) is now much slower. Fireman carry or use roller bed or other
      similar item to move someone faster if they are unable or unwilling to stand.
  - rscadd: Handcuffed players may now severely injure one of their arms to break
      out of cuffs quickly, dealing 50 damage to a random arm or completely dismembering
      it if they are a race that is easily delimbed. Bear in mind that this option
      may not be wise to utilize depending on the circumstances you're in.
  - bugfix: You now stop trying to break out of handcuffs if someone else removes
      them
  Schoolboy215:

  - rscadd: You can now right-click an ATMOS holofan projector to enable "clearview"

  ClownMoff:
  - rscadd: Clowns can now PDA everyone with a one and a half minute cooldown
  Rukofamicom:
  - balance: IPCs have had their racial traits adjusted to make them stand out as
      a unique race a bit more
  - tweak: IPCs are now immune to pressure damage, but instead spring an oil leak,
      which gives them a greater resistance to space exposure without protection but
      they will still suffer in the long-term if not prepared.
  - tweak: IPCs are no longer immune to radiation and will suffer burns instead of
      toxin damage from prolonged radiation exposure. System Cleaner now purges radiation
      from IPCs in addition to its other effects though.
  - tweak: IPCs now take 1.5x damage from brute damage.
  - tweak: IPCs now take 1.5x damage from fires and burn damage, down from 3x and
      2x respectively.
  - tweak: IPCs remain functional in soft crit, but still take low steady damage over
      time when they reach this state.
  - tweak: IPCs are now immune to stamina damage, and stun batons electrocute them
      for 15 burn damage. Disablers have no effect on IPCs,
  - tweak: IPCs now have the easy limb disable trait, meaning they take 40% less damage
      to disable a limb
  - tweak: Dismembering a chest is only possible on dead mobs now, no more early organ
      spilling.
  - bugfix: Fixed the frail quirk, as well as other instances of easy limb disable.
      They were non-functional in the code for an unknown amount of time.
  - bugfix: Mobs that have the easy limb dismemberment trait will now find that they
      lose their limbs to blunt damage after having them disabled as was originally
      intended. Previously only the RNG chance was being rolled without the guaranteed
      dismemberment. This notably affects Skeletons, Zombies, Oozelings and IPCs.
  - bugfix: Energy swords and daggers have the appropriate sharpness again. Energy
      swords can dismember easily, and energy daggers can dismember as soon as the
      limb is disabled.
