      the combustion jetpack, which can move up and down in gravity as well as function

      (ideally at a ~50% ratio).
  - rscadd: Added z-level changing buttons to the advanced camera console.
  - balance: Zfalls now do more damage per level fallen, and felinids falling more

  - rscadd: Added the "rocket jetpack", a jetpack designed for in-gravity flight,
      that burns plasma and oxygen.

      (you can even move onto a solid tile to "break" your fall)
