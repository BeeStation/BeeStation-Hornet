2025-11-02:
  Varo10, Rukofamicom:
  - balance: Wizard robes, hardsuit and modsuit can now store ANY item available for
      purchase from the spellbook in the suit storage slot. Wizard staves have been
      downgraded from huge to bulky in order to accomodate this change.
  - balance: Wizard wands now recharge like staves, but take longer per charge and
      hold less maximum charges.
  - balance: All wizards and apprentices now start with a wand belt and teleportation
      spell instead of teleportation scroll. Fully fledged wizards will find their
      wand belt always contains a healing wand and three random wands.
  - tweak: While the fully loaded wand belt is no longer available from the spellbook,
      individual wands may now be acquired for 1 point each.
  - balance: All wand effects have been reworked except for the teleportation wand.
      Some of them have entirely new effects, and some of them have weakened versions
      of their old effects to make up for being pocket sized spell guns that now regenerate.
      Think of wands as the wizard sidearm to their more powerful spells and staves.
  - rscadd: Brand new effects have been added to both staves and wands, including
      a new icy blast that freezes the ground, a life draining effect, the ability
      to end universal hunger, the ability to mutate your victims, and even one that
      rips their arms and legs off!
  - rscdel: Instances where there was both a wand and staff version of a given spell
      have been eliminated to make room for the new effects mentioned above. No wand
      or staff effects were actually removed entirely though, just duplicate effects.
  - rscadd: Adds a new spell, Bolt of Instant Death. The wand of death was turned
      into a spell with a cooldown instead of being kept in a spammable form now that
      wands regenerate charges.
  - rscadd: Adds a new spell, Arcane Prison. This spell acts as a cheaper and shorter
      lasting version of the spell cast by the locker staff. The prison is also transparent
      and will cause the victims it releases to be knocked down for a few seconds
      after bursting.
  - rscadd: Adds a new spell, Raise Lesser Skeleton. Unlike the necromantic stone
      this spell does not bind the original soul of its victim to you, instead ripping
      the skeleton out and offering it to ghosts while leaving the victim otherwise
      recoverable. Even without available souls this spell will succeed, but will
      instead create a mindlessly aggressive skeleton ally.
  - rscadd: Adds the Glasses of Truesight which enable the wearer to see mobs through
      walls. They do not offer full x-ray vision, only the location of mobs are revealed.
  - rscadd: Adds the Ring of Translocation, which enables its wearer to swap places
      with anyone they can see on a short cooldown.
  - rscadd: Blood Contract has been added to the wizard spellbook as a consumable
      item.  The Blood Contract can be applied to any target from anywhere, and will
      drive them to madness - cursed to believe their fellow crew are demons that
      need to be slaughtered. Crew will be forced to murder anyone under the effect
      of this contract or else be murdered themselves.
  - tweak: Warp Whistle is now a small item so you can store it in your pocket. It
      also now fits in the suit slot for wizard gear as mentioned above.
  - tweak: Staff of change (and related effects) will now be generally more random
      in what they select for transformation. 33% chance of a random humanoid species,
      33% robot, 33% anything else. Xenos, slimes and monkeys are no longer an exceptionally
      high chance, and syndiborg are no longer on the top of the robot chances.
  - rscdel: Removes the mutate spell
  - bugfix: Psyphoza and Lizard exclusive mutations are both actually exclusive to
      those races now as intended.

2025-11-16:
  BotTierPC:
  - tweak: Fixes Metastation Service Access by changing mapping_helpers
  Rukofamicom:
  - tweak: Supermatter delaminations now scale with how long the crystal has been
      powered. This means if someone who is still learning messes up during the initial
      setup, the explosion will be much smaller than if the engine has been running
      for a while before it went south.
  - tweak: Supermatter crystal explosions will reach their previous maximum force
      after being powered for 45 minutes, but they will continue to grow after this
      point meaning they are only capped in power by the duration of the round.
  - tweak: Tesla and Singularity delaminations have scaling requirements as well,
      but these values plateau to their old requirements after the supermatter has
      been powered for 45 minutes.

  - bugfix: Most martial arts now ignore blocking entirely, with Krav Maga, Boxing
      and Psychotic Brawling being the exceptions that are still blockable. Don't
      fight the chef on his turf.
  - bugfix: Items which block projectiles now correctly report their behavior when
      examined
  - bugfix: Blocked projectiles no longer trigger their on_hit effects. They didn't
      hit after all.
  - bugfix: Stun batons (and subtypes of them) can now be blocked properly. There
      was a major refactor to stun baton code, so please report anything unusual you
      notice.
  - tweak: Stun Batons (and subtypes) can no longer harm baton. They do either stamina
      damage when on, or brute when they are off.
  - tweak: Stun batons (and subtypes) as well as telescopic batons do not deal any
      stamina or shield damage when successfully blocked. They still trigger the block
      cooldown, but you're going to need something stronger to break through a shield.
  - tweak: Teleprods can now be worn on the back and have backsprites
  Sarchutar:
  - rscadd: Added a MOD team-tracker module, all Syndicate and ERT MODsuits have it

  PowerfulBacon:
  - balance: Buffs tasers, making them easier to aim, giving them longer range while
      you are moving, and decreasing the number of things that can fully block the

      the firer or breaking line of sight with the firer.

      organize.

  - balance: Ninja invisibility is now limited to 40 seconds, but that timer increases
      while in the dark.
  - balance: Ninja invisibility disables when any other ability is activated.
  Rukofamicom:
  - bugfix: Unintentionally buffed bola durations have been reverted to their prior
      values. Energy bolas will last for 3 seconds and reinforced bolas for 7 seconds,
      down from being accidentally buffed to 5 and 10 respectively.
  - tweak: Rather than applying a hardcoded slowdown when hit with a bola, players
      are knocked down for the intended escape duration and bolas will automatically
      fall off after the intended duration is up
  - tweak: Energy bolas are no longer consumed upon hitting a target
  - tweak: Gonbolas have had their duration reduced from 30 seconds to 10 seconds
      since they are also knockdown instead of just a pacification tool now.
  - rscadd: Players will now be regularly given a proper poll for ending the round
      after a certain amount of time has passed. Only players who participate in the
      voting system will be counted and a vote of at least 50% is required to call
      the shuttle no matter how much time has passed.
  - tweak: The maximum time for the evacuation shuttle is now 10 minutes for both
      green alert and cases where every option for calling the shuttle is destroyed.
  - tweak: Blue alert shuttles now take 7.5 minutes.
  - tweak: Round length is now capped at four hours instead of two, with this value
      being directly configurable for future tweaks.

  EvilDragonfiend (credit to r1ks-iwnl for grammar correction):
  - rscadd: New bounty has been added - Profession manuscript. To write a manuscript,
      find an empty "manuscript" book first. You can get them from random book shelves
      with 5% chance, or get one from cargo book ordering, and then click the book
      with your pen. Antagonist can write a manuscript in any job (but everyone has
      15 minutes cooldown to write one). There are always assistant bounty, and random
      3 jobs.
  - rscadd: a tiny helper code that cargo shuttle only needs short seconds to move
      when debugging
  Rukofamicom:
  - tweak: When an APC loses its powernet connection connection, department lights
      will switch to emergency mode almost immediately to conserve power to be spent
      on keeping the area operational for longer.
  - tweak: An APC without an active connection will now continue to power departmental
      equipment until it reaches 15% charge, instead of shutting off vital machinery
      at 50% charge.
  - tweak: APCs now hold 50% more maximum charge at roundstart, and start with 100%
      charge instead of 90%.
