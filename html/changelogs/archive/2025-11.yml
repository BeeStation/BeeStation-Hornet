  Varo10, Rukofamicom:
  - balance: Wizard robes, hardsuit and modsuit can now store ANY item available for
      purchase from the spellbook in the suit storage slot. Wizard staves have been
      downgraded from huge to bulky in order to accomodate this change.
  - balance: Wizard wands now recharge like staves, but take longer per charge and
      hold less maximum charges.
  - balance: All wizards and apprentices now start with a wand belt and teleportation
      spell instead of teleportation scroll. Fully fledged wizards will find their
      wand belt always contains a healing wand and three random wands.
  - tweak: While the fully loaded wand belt is no longer available from the spellbook,
      individual wands may now be acquired for 1 point each.
  - balance: All wand effects have been reworked except for the teleportation wand.
      Some of them have entirely new effects, and some of them have weakened versions
      of their old effects to make up for being pocket sized spell guns that now regenerate.
      Think of wands as the wizard sidearm to their more powerful spells and staves.
  - rscadd: Brand new effects have been added to both staves and wands, including
      a new icy blast that freezes the ground, a life draining effect, the ability
      to end universal hunger, the ability to mutate your victims, and even one that
      rips their arms and legs off!
  - rscdel: Instances where there was both a wand and staff version of a given spell
      have been eliminated to make room for the new effects mentioned above. No wand
      or staff effects were actually removed entirely though, just duplicate effects.
  - rscadd: Adds a new spell, Bolt of Instant Death. The wand of death was turned
      into a spell with a cooldown instead of being kept in a spammable form now that
      wands regenerate charges.
  - rscadd: Adds a new spell, Arcane Prison. This spell acts as a cheaper and shorter
      lasting version of the spell cast by the locker staff. The prison is also transparent
      and will cause the victims it releases to be knocked down for a few seconds
      after bursting.
  - rscadd: Adds a new spell, Raise Lesser Skeleton. Unlike the necromantic stone
      this spell does not bind the original soul of its victim to you, instead ripping
      the skeleton out and offering it to ghosts while leaving the victim otherwise
      recoverable. Even without available souls this spell will succeed, but will
      instead create a mindlessly aggressive skeleton ally.
  - rscadd: Adds the Glasses of Truesight which enable the wearer to see mobs through
      walls. They do not offer full x-ray vision, only the location of mobs are revealed.
  - rscadd: Adds the Ring of Translocation, which enables its wearer to swap places
      with anyone they can see on a short cooldown.
  - rscadd: Blood Contract has been added to the wizard spellbook as a consumable
      item.  The Blood Contract can be applied to any target from anywhere, and will
      drive them to madness - cursed to believe their fellow crew are demons that
      need to be slaughtered. Crew will be forced to murder anyone under the effect
      of this contract or else be murdered themselves.
  - tweak: Warp Whistle is now a small item so you can store it in your pocket. It
      also now fits in the suit slot for wizard gear as mentioned above.
  - tweak: Staff of change (and related effects) will now be generally more random
      in what they select for transformation. 33% chance of a random humanoid species,
      33% robot, 33% anything else. Xenos, slimes and monkeys are no longer an exceptionally
      high chance, and syndiborg are no longer on the top of the robot chances.
  - rscdel: Removes the mutate spell
  - bugfix: Psyphoza and Lizard exclusive mutations are both actually exclusive to
      those races now as intended.
