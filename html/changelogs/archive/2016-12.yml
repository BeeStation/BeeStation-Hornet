      something else to do/someone to kill
  - bugfix: Hostile mobs with search_objects will now regain that value after a certain
      amount of time (per-mob, base 3 seconds), this is because being attacked causes
      mobs with this var to turn it off, so they can run away, however it was literally
      never turned on which caused swarmers to get depression and never do anything.

      does not pull the target but instead pulls whatever item he''s holding in his
      hands to yours; - Grab intent puts the target into an aggressive grab after
      it is pulled, allowing you to throw it or try to consume it; - Harm intent will

      to one guardian, meaning they can have up to 5. If that's wise is an entirely
      different question.
  - experiment: Wizards cannot buy support guardians, but can buy dexterous guardians,
      which can hold items.
  Shadowlight213:

  - bugfix: The charge spell will no longer bilk you on wand charges, and wands that
      are dead won't show up as charged.
  Joan:
  - rscdel: Clockwork Marauders no longer have Fatigue. It was difficult to balance

      they aren't forced to recall by anything, but can accordingly die much more
      easily.
  - rscadd: Accordingly Clockwork Marauders now have more health, do slightly more
      damage, block slightly more often, and have to go slightly further from their
      host to take damage.
  - rscadd: Marauders that are not recovering(from recalling while the host's health

      you to speak in a HEAVY TONE. This voice can compel hearers to briefly obey
      certain codewords, such as "STOP". Using these codewords will severely increase
      this ability's cooldown, and only one will be used per sentence.
  - rscadd: 'Use .x, :x, or #x as a prefix to use Voice of God or any future vocal
      cord organs.'
