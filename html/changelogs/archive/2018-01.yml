  - rscadd: 'A new cocktail: The Nar''Sour. Made from blood, demonsblood, and lemon

  - bugfix: The Syndicate Listening Post's medicine closet now has the correct access.

2018-01-27:
  Anonmare:

  Robustin:
  - rscadd: Blood magic. The next generation of talismans - you can create 2 spells
      without a rune, up to 5 with a rune of empowerment. Preparing spells without
      a rune will cost a significant amount of blood. Every talisman has been rebalanced
      for its spell form. With a few exceptions, blood magic exists as a "touch" spell
      that is very similar in behavior/appearance to the wizard touch spells.
  - rscadd: New UI system for cultists.
  - rscdel: Removed talismans, Talisman Creation Rune replaced by Rune of Empowerment.
      Supply talisman has been replaced by a ritual dagger and 10 runed metal.

  - tweak: Only the cult master can forge Bastard swords now, regular cultists can
      get a mirror shield.
  - rscadd: 'The mirror shield, it blocks, it reflects, it creates illusions, and
      an incredible throwing weapon! The mirror shield also bears a unique weakness:
      Shotgun slugs, .357 rounds, and other high damage projectiles will instantly
      shatter it and briefly stun the holder.'
  - balance: Nar'sien Bolas will not longer ensnare cultists and non-cultists will
      ensnare themselves when attempting to use them. The bolas are now comparable
      in effectiveness with reinforced bolas.
  - rscadd: Rune of Spirits. This merges the Spirit Sight and Manifest Ghost rune.
      The user will now choose which effect when invoking.
  - rscadd: The Spirit Sight function has received several major improvements, allowing
      the ghost to commune with the cult and mark objects similar how the cult master
      can. The user has a unique appearance while ghosted and manifested cult ghosts
      can see ghosts as well - allowing their summoner to lead them from the spirit
      realm.
  - balance: The Form Barrier rune will now last significantly longer and examining
      the rune as a cultist will tell you how long it will remain.
  - rscadd: The Apocalypse Rune. Replaces the EMP runes. Has a fixed invoker requirement
      and added usage limitations.  It scales depending on the crew's strength relative
      to the cult. Effect includes a massive EMP, unique hallucination for non-cultists,
      and if the cult is doing poorly, certain events. The rune can only occur in
      the Nar-Sie ritual sites and will prevent Nar-Sie from being summoned there
      in the future.
  - rscdel: No more EMP rune.
  - balance: The conceal/reveal spell now has 10 charges and will conceal far more,
      including cult structures and flooring.

  - balance: The hallucination spell now has multiple charges.
  - tweak: The teleport spell can now be used on other adjacent cultists.
  - tweak: Summon Tome and Summon Armor have been combined into "Summon Equipment",
      which lets you choose between summoning a Ritual Dagger or Combat Gear (same
      loadout that Summon Armor used to provide).
  - balance: Standard cult robes now have -10 melee and -10 laser armor.
  - balance: The "Construction" spell will now convert airlocks into cult airlocks
      and cyborgs (after ~10 seconds) into constructs. The airlock is the most fragile
      in the game, with reduced integrity, armor, and render it vulnerable to most
      attacks. Cyborg "reconstruction" will be accompanied by an obvious effect/sound.
  - rscadd: Blood Rites. This spell allows you to absorb blood from your surroundings
      or adjacent non-cultists. You can use the blood rites as a convenient heal (self-healing
      is significantly more costly though) or you can try to gather large quantities
      of blood for unique and powerful relics.
  - rscadd: Blood spear, a fragile but robust spear with a special recall ability
  - rscadd: Blood bolts, the cultist's version of arcane barrage. The bolts will infuse
      cultists with unholy water and damage anything else.
  - rscadd: Blood beam, the ultimate blood rite. After a channeling period it will
      fire 12 powerful beams across a long distance, piercing almost any surface (except
      blessed turf), and damaging all non-cult life caught in the beam.
  - tweak: All cult structures now generate significantly less light.
  - balance: Pylons will now heal constructs faster and restore slightly more blood
      than before.
  - balance: Cult floors are now highly resistant to atmospheric changes.
  - bugfix: Unholy water will now splash victims properly.

      at healing brute, and deals slightly more damage to non-cultists, the splash
      ratio was reduced to 20% to compensate for the increased volume and damage.
  - balance: Holy water will purge any and all blood spells from cultists.
  - rscadd: Artificers, Wraiths and Juggernauts can now scribe revive, teleport, and
      barrier runes respectively with a 3 minute cooldown.
  - balance: Juggernauts' forcewall is now 3x1 but it has a ~30% longer cooldown.
      Juggernauts got a modest speed increase (2.5 from 3) but lost a modest amount
      of HP (200 from 250).
  - rscadd: Juggernauts now get a ranged attack "Gauntlet Echo", a single projectile
      that moves about as fast as them and does 30 damage with 5 seconds of stun and
      a 35s cooldown.
  - balance: The number of ghosts summonable by the manifest spirit rune is 3, down
      from 5.
  - balance: It now takes ~20% less water (~25 units) and ~30 seconds less to deconvert
      cultists via holy water.
  - tweak: The emagged library console will now distribute ritual daggers.
  - tweak: Using the dagger on a rune will now take a 1-second channel to destroy
      it, to avoid incidents where people instantly wipe a critical rune by accident.
  - balance: Standard runed airlocks now have a lower damage deflection so they can
      be destroyed with most respectable melee weapons (10+).
  - balance: Teleporter runes that are used from space or lavaland will result in
      the destination rune giving off a unique effect for 60 seconds. This effect
      includes a long distance (but not obvious antagonistic) sound, a bright lighting
      effect, and a visual cue that will indicate where the cultist arrived from.
  Shadowlight213:
  - tweak: Pluoxium is no longer considered dangerous for air alarms.
  XDTM:
  - tweak: Slimepeople can now host multiple minds in their body pool; occupied bodies
      will be marked as such in the bodyswap panel.
  - tweak: Slimepeople now retain 45% of their slime volume upon splitting instead
      of a fixed amount.
  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: Defibrillator mounts can now be found in the CMO's locker or produced
      from a medical protolathe after Biotech is unlocked. They can be attached to
      walls, and hold defibrillators for public use. You can swipe an ID to clamp
      the defibrillator in place, and it will automatically draw from the powernet
      to recharge it. Being one tile away from the mount will force you to drop the
      paddles.
  - balance: Stargazers have been removed.
  - balance: The clockwork cult now has a power cap of 50 kW.
