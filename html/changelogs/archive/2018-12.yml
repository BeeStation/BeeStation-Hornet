      faster, doesn't retreat, and is immune to projectiles. All while throwing out
      ground slam attacks around him that throw people around.

      easily cheesed because it couldn't move through walls with just hugging the
      edges of walls and just made him too hard to balance.

      cooldown for his melee attacks. This means you're much less likely to stand
      next to him and not get hit.

      to predict where he's going to go and makes it so he can catch up to you easier.
