      one type. Beware, it only produces one crossbred extract!

      in the future.

      required amount of the following extract colors: Grey, orange, purple, blue,
      metal, yellow, dark purple, silver, cerulean, and pyrite. Their relevant effects
      will be added to the wiki page for xenobiology soon(TM), and more to come in
      a later addition!'
