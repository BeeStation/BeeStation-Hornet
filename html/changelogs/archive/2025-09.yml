  Powerfulbacon (sprites), Rukofamicom:
  - rscdel: Removed block levels from all items. Items that can block will block the
      tiles directly and diagonally in front of you. Attacks from the sides or rear
      diagonals will bypass blocking attempts. Walk/Run no longer has any impact on
      your ability to block.
  - balance: Blocking with a weapon now has a two second cooldown unless you were
      blocking projectiles, and it also triggers your melee attack cooldown slowing
      your next attack. Blocking with a weapon will also fail if you have more than
      45 stamina damage.
  - balance: Blocking with shields now results in faster stamina damage buildup, and
      the shield will be sent flying from your hand at more than 45 stamina damage
  - balance: Blocking an incoming melee attack has entirely new calculations that
      follow the same spirit as the old ones but with less extreme outcomes. Sharp
      and non-brute weapons are easier to block than blunt ones.
  - tweak: blocking stamina is no longer limb based
  - tweak: 'Added or changed blocking capabilities and/or damage stats of the following
      weapons. Examine them in-game for more details: Many nullrod options, Rod of
      Asclepius (activated), energy swords, scythes, spears, proto-kinetic accelerator,
      mime traitor baguette, mops, teleprods, ghost sword.'
  - rscadd: three new blocking flags that will be revealed on examining weapons. The
      flags are BLOCKING_COUNTERATTACK which does what it sounds like, BLOCKING_UNBALANCE
      for long weapons which trips your opponent and delays their next attack, and
      BLOCKING_UNBLOCKABLE which can only be blocked by itself and is reserved for
      magical or energy weapons and energy shields.
  - rscadd: Adds the Carbon Fiber Saber to security lockers scattered across the station.
      This item is nearly identical to the captain's saber, but has much less armor
      penetration and normal sharpness.
  - bugfix: Fixes energy shield in-hand sprites so that they are now visible in player
      hands again
  - bugfix: Fixes energy shields functionality as well - they would never recharge,
      but this may have gone unnoticed because they also weren't required to charge
      before being deployed again.
  - tweak: Energy shields are now much cheaper (5 TC) and available in regular uplinks
      instead of only nuclear operative uplinks. This extends to the bananium shield
      being cheaper for clowns as well.
  Rukofamicom:
  - bugfix: Goliath lava boats now work again by properly accepting the oar they need
      to function
  lord scrubling:
  - bugfix: Anomaly cores are no longer all blue
  - bugfix: Cores from diffused anomalies fit in anomaly modsuit modules
  - bugfix: The threadripper modsuit module is no longer visible even when not selected
  mrmanlikesbt, lizardqueenlexi:
  - bugfix: fixed cursed hearts
  r1ks-iwnl:
  - bugfix: Changeling's Last Resort no longer traps you as a monkey forever(The human
      form button is visible again)
  - bugfix: Changeling's Lesser Form no longer traps you as a monkey forever(The human
      form button is visible again)
  - bugfix: Changeling's chem HUD disappearing forever after you turn into a monkey
  rkz, Timberpoes:
  - admin: Re-added the button to the player playtime panel that lets admins toggle
      a player's job playtime exemption status.
  - refactor: Rewrite the way we handle which roles get assigned with playtime tracking.
  - bugfix: Players who get MMI'd and put into borgs or AIs mid-shift now gain job
      playtime tracking towards Silicon roles instead.

  PowerfulBacon:
  - tweak: Only conscious people can hear LOOC.
  Solene Ft. Bacon, Ruko, Ark and engineering nerds on discord:
  - rscdel: Removed Joules
  - tweak: Power now always only shows up to 1 decimal to simplify reading.
  - code_imp: Reworks Power measures
  - tweak: Reworks Power Cell charges and other calculations
  - tweak: Inducers and Cell Chargers now depend on cell recharge rates for their
      calculation
  - bugfix: Fixed Inducer / Cell charge power duplication exploit
  - rscadd: Energy weapons now display remaining shots to depletion on their examine.
  - bugfix: Modular Computers will now drain the proper power depending on if they
      are shut down or enabled.
  - bugfix: Modular Computers now display power drain accurately
  - refactor: Refactored Cell Charger code to be more accurate and avoid dupes.
  - refactor: Refactored power usage updates on some machinery solving duplicated
      power draws
  - balance: Rebalanced some power usage costs for machinery
  - tweak: SMES's now take matter bins instead of cells and display TOTAL POWER
  - refactor: Changed how SMES's calculate total power and other boring things
  - tweak: APCs now display total power
  - refactor: Refactored APC code regarding power. APCs are fasted, more accurate
      in their calculations and don't freeze randomly. Also they now display sound,
      text and overlays that were intended but were poorly coded so never seen.
  - refactor: Refactored Recharger code.
  - bugfix: Fixed lights drawing power twice
  - balance: Rebalances costs for power consumption of most machinery to ensure lights
      aren't the only things drawing any noticeable power.
  - code_imp: Fixed some instances where machines weren't using the right proc to
      discern if they're in IDLE or ACTIVE power consumption modes.
  - refactor: Refactored emitter code so they have less of a mind of their own and
      actually fire if there is enough power.
  - rscadd: Added a special power draw mechanic to the gravity generator (Since it
      had no power cost to begin with). If it's either powering up or powering down
      it's power use will be 10 times higher than when it is stable.
  lord scrubling:
  - bugfix: plasmamen receive a helmet and internals after being captured
2025-09-10:
  PowerfulBacon:
  - tweak: 'Includes players who joined, players who joined roundstart, and total
      client connections in the #ooc information of a round'
