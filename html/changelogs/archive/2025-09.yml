  Powerfulbacon (sprites), Rukofamicom:
  - rscdel: Removed block levels from all items. Items that can block will block the
      tiles directly and diagonally in front of you. Attacks from the sides or rear
      diagonals will bypass blocking attempts. Walk/Run no longer has any impact on
      your ability to block.
  - balance: Blocking with a weapon now has a two second cooldown unless you were
      blocking projectiles, and it also triggers your melee attack cooldown slowing
      your next attack. Blocking with a weapon will also fail if you have more than
      45 stamina damage.
  - balance: Blocking with shields now results in faster stamina damage buildup, and
      the shield will be sent flying from your hand at more than 45 stamina damage
  - balance: Blocking an incoming melee attack has entirely new calculations that
      follow the same spirit as the old ones but with less extreme outcomes. Sharp
      and non-brute weapons are easier to block than blunt ones.
  - tweak: blocking stamina is no longer limb based
  - tweak: 'Added or changed blocking capabilities and/or damage stats of the following
      weapons. Examine them in-game for more details: Many nullrod options, Rod of
      Asclepius (activated), energy swords, scythes, spears, proto-kinetic accelerator,
      mime traitor baguette, mops, teleprods, ghost sword.'
  - rscadd: three new blocking flags that will be revealed on examining weapons. The
      flags are BLOCKING_COUNTERATTACK which does what it sounds like, BLOCKING_UNBALANCE
      for long weapons which trips your opponent and delays their next attack, and
      BLOCKING_UNBLOCKABLE which can only be blocked by itself and is reserved for
      magical or energy weapons and energy shields.
  - rscadd: Adds the Carbon Fiber Saber to security lockers scattered across the station.
      This item is nearly identical to the captain's saber, but has much less armor
      penetration and normal sharpness.
  - bugfix: Fixes energy shield in-hand sprites so that they are now visible in player
      hands again
  - bugfix: Fixes energy shields functionality as well - they would never recharge,
      but this may have gone unnoticed because they also weren't required to charge
      before being deployed again.
  - tweak: Energy shields are now much cheaper (5 TC) and available in regular uplinks
      instead of only nuclear operative uplinks. This extends to the bananium shield
      being cheaper for clowns as well.
  Rukofamicom:
  - bugfix: Goliath lava boats now work again by properly accepting the oar they need
      to function
