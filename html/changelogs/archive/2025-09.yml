  Powerfulbacon (sprites), Rukofamicom:
  - rscdel: Removed block levels from all items. Items that can block will block the
      tiles directly and diagonally in front of you. Attacks from the sides or rear
      diagonals will bypass blocking attempts. Walk/Run no longer has any impact on
      your ability to block.
  - balance: Blocking with a weapon now has a two second cooldown unless you were
      blocking projectiles, and it also triggers your melee attack cooldown slowing
      your next attack. Blocking with a weapon will also fail if you have more than
      45 stamina damage.
  - balance: Blocking with shields now results in faster stamina damage buildup, and
      the shield will be sent flying from your hand at more than 45 stamina damage
  - balance: Blocking an incoming melee attack has entirely new calculations that
      follow the same spirit as the old ones but with less extreme outcomes. Sharp
      and non-brute weapons are easier to block than blunt ones.
  - tweak: blocking stamina is no longer limb based
  - tweak: 'Added or changed blocking capabilities and/or damage stats of the following
      weapons. Examine them in-game for more details: Many nullrod options, Rod of
      Asclepius (activated), energy swords, scythes, spears, proto-kinetic accelerator,
      mime traitor baguette, mops, teleprods, ghost sword.'
  - rscadd: three new blocking flags that will be revealed on examining weapons. The
      flags are BLOCKING_COUNTERATTACK which does what it sounds like, BLOCKING_UNBALANCE
      for long weapons which trips your opponent and delays their next attack, and
      BLOCKING_UNBLOCKABLE which can only be blocked by itself and is reserved for
      magical or energy weapons and energy shields.
  - rscadd: Adds the Carbon Fiber Saber to security lockers scattered across the station.
      This item is nearly identical to the captain's saber, but has much less armor
      penetration and normal sharpness.
  - bugfix: Fixes energy shield in-hand sprites so that they are now visible in player
      hands again
  - bugfix: Fixes energy shields functionality as well - they would never recharge,
      but this may have gone unnoticed because they also weren't required to charge
      before being deployed again.
  - tweak: Energy shields are now much cheaper (5 TC) and available in regular uplinks
      instead of only nuclear operative uplinks. This extends to the bananium shield
      being cheaper for clowns as well.
  Rukofamicom:
  - bugfix: Goliath lava boats now work again by properly accepting the oar they need
      to function
  lord scrubling:
  - bugfix: Anomaly cores are no longer all blue
  - bugfix: Cores from diffused anomalies fit in anomaly modsuit modules
  - bugfix: The threadripper modsuit module is no longer visible even when not selected
  mrmanlikesbt, lizardqueenlexi:
  - bugfix: fixed cursed hearts
  r1ks-iwnl:
  - bugfix: Changeling's Last Resort no longer traps you as a monkey forever(The human
      form button is visible again)
  - bugfix: Changeling's Lesser Form no longer traps you as a monkey forever(The human
      form button is visible again)
  - bugfix: Changeling's chem HUD disappearing forever after you turn into a monkey
  rkz, Timberpoes:
  - admin: Re-added the button to the player playtime panel that lets admins toggle
      a player's job playtime exemption status.
  - refactor: Rewrite the way we handle which roles get assigned with playtime tracking.
  - bugfix: Players who get MMI'd and put into borgs or AIs mid-shift now gain job
      playtime tracking towards Silicon roles instead.

  PowerfulBacon:
  - tweak: Only conscious people can hear LOOC.
  Solene Ft. Bacon, Ruko, Ark and engineering nerds on discord:
  - rscdel: Removed Joules
  - tweak: Power now always only shows up to 1 decimal to simplify reading.
  - code_imp: Reworks Power measures
  - tweak: Reworks Power Cell charges and other calculations
  - tweak: Inducers and Cell Chargers now depend on cell recharge rates for their
      calculation
  - bugfix: Fixed Inducer / Cell charge power duplication exploit
  - rscadd: Energy weapons now display remaining shots to depletion on their examine.
  - bugfix: Modular Computers will now drain the proper power depending on if they
      are shut down or enabled.
  - bugfix: Modular Computers now display power drain accurately
  - refactor: Refactored Cell Charger code to be more accurate and avoid dupes.
  - refactor: Refactored power usage updates on some machinery solving duplicated
      power draws

  - tweak: SMES's now take matter bins instead of cells and display TOTAL POWER
  - refactor: Changed how SMES's calculate total power and other boring things
  - tweak: APCs now display total power
  - refactor: Refactored APC code regarding power. APCs are fasted, more accurate
      in their calculations and don't freeze randomly. Also they now display sound,
      text and overlays that were intended but were poorly coded so never seen.
  - refactor: Refactored Recharger code.
  - bugfix: Fixed lights drawing power twice
  - balance: Rebalances costs for power consumption of most machinery to ensure lights
      aren't the only things drawing any noticeable power.
  - code_imp: Fixed some instances where machines weren't using the right proc to
      discern if they're in IDLE or ACTIVE power consumption modes.
  - refactor: Refactored emitter code so they have less of a mind of their own and
      actually fire if there is enough power.
  - rscadd: Added a special power draw mechanic to the gravity generator (Since it
      had no power cost to begin with). If it's either powering up or powering down
      it's power use will be 10 times higher than when it is stable.
  lord scrubling:
  - bugfix: plasmamen receive a helmet and internals after being captured
2025-09-10:

      client connections in the #ooc information of a round'
2025-09-12:
  PowerfulBacon:
  - balance: Energy katana is now deleted when the ninja is killed.
  - balance: Energy katana dash no longer has changes, but has a 1.4 second cooldown
      on usage instead. This cooldown blocks all user actions and is telegraphed.
  - balance: Energy katana dash no longer can go through people, but instead will
      attack and push back the person that you hit.
  - balance: Energy katana can no longer delimb, this has been replaced with delimbing
      strike. An ability that allows the ninja to attack the 3 tiles in front of it,
      deilmbing anyone who gets caught in the attack.
  - balance: Energy katana damage decreased to 22, down from 30.
  - balance: Reduces their armour, particularly against melee attacks.
  - balance: Stealth now grants 100% invisibility and runs through a standardised
      status effect.

2025-09-14:
  Solene:
  - rscadd: Added hotswap to every computer component.
  - balance: Doubled battery size (lets see if it sticks this time)
  - tweak: Reworked Power cell controlers. Now they're simply batteries and you don't
      need 2 battery type components.
  - tweak: Changed names of computer batteries to be more descriptive of their size.
  - bugfix: Fixed a message error in primary card slot hacking
  - bugfix: Fixed a runtime happening during Detomatix virus injection on targets
      without battery
  - bugfix: Standard batteries no longer fit laptops, sorry guys
  SunShine214, Nakalon:
  - rscadd: The Advanced Gas Rig, capable of mining gases from the planet the station
      is orbiting.
  - rscadd: Gas Rig Monitor program, which uses NTnet to remotely control the gas
      rig
  - rscadd: Adds a Gas Rig Shielding power value to each gas
  - tweak: Adjusted maps to fit the new gas rig.
  - tweak: Waste now is vented, rather then filtered out. The filter line is for the
      gas rig now.
  - rscdel: Removed gas miners from all maps except for echo, as the gas rig being
      there makes no sense
  lord scrubling:
  - rscadd: resin mister upgrades can now be applied to the modsuit module
  - bugfix: the resin mister module now deploys
  - refactor: watertank backpacks are more flexible
  ? mrmanlikesbt, MrMelbert, san7890, SuperNovaa41, Watermelon914, lessthnthree, ZephyrTFA,
    Jacquerel, AnywayFarus, imedial, SmArtKar
  : - rscadd: Added the "Vote" verb the OOC tab, here you can check the status of
        current voting or call them if you are able.
    - tweak: Map votes now use a tally system instead of weighted RNG. What this means
        is that votes for the maps that did not win will carry over to the next map
        vote, and when that map eventually wins its tallies will be reset.
    - refactor: refactored the voting subsystem
    - tweak: Slightly altered the Emergency Shuttle undocking announcement
