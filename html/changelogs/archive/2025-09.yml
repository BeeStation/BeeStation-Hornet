  Powerfulbacon (sprites), Rukofamicom:
  - rscdel: Removed block levels from all items. Items that can block will block the
      tiles directly and diagonally in front of you. Attacks from the sides or rear
      diagonals will bypass blocking attempts. Walk/Run no longer has any impact on
      your ability to block.
  - balance: Blocking with a weapon now has a two second cooldown unless you were
      blocking projectiles, and it also triggers your melee attack cooldown slowing
      your next attack. Blocking with a weapon will also fail if you have more than
      45 stamina damage.
  - balance: Blocking with shields now results in faster stamina damage buildup, and
      the shield will be sent flying from your hand at more than 45 stamina damage
  - balance: Blocking an incoming melee attack has entirely new calculations that
      follow the same spirit as the old ones but with less extreme outcomes. Sharp
      and non-brute weapons are easier to block than blunt ones.
  - tweak: blocking stamina is no longer limb based
  - tweak: 'Added or changed blocking capabilities and/or damage stats of the following
      weapons. Examine them in-game for more details: Many nullrod options, Rod of
      Asclepius (activated), energy swords, scythes, spears, proto-kinetic accelerator,
      mime traitor baguette, mops, teleprods, ghost sword.'
  - rscadd: three new blocking flags that will be revealed on examining weapons. The
      flags are BLOCKING_COUNTERATTACK which does what it sounds like, BLOCKING_UNBALANCE
      for long weapons which trips your opponent and delays their next attack, and
      BLOCKING_UNBLOCKABLE which can only be blocked by itself and is reserved for
      magical or energy weapons and energy shields.
  - rscadd: Adds the Carbon Fiber Saber to security lockers scattered across the station.
      This item is nearly identical to the captain's saber, but has much less armor
      penetration and normal sharpness.
  - bugfix: Fixes energy shield in-hand sprites so that they are now visible in player
      hands again
  - bugfix: Fixes energy shields functionality as well - they would never recharge,
      but this may have gone unnoticed because they also weren't required to charge
      before being deployed again.
  - tweak: Energy shields are now much cheaper (5 TC) and available in regular uplinks
      instead of only nuclear operative uplinks. This extends to the bananium shield
      being cheaper for clowns as well.
  Rukofamicom:
  - bugfix: Goliath lava boats now work again by properly accepting the oar they need
      to function
  lord scrubling:

  - refactor: Refactored Recharger code.
  - bugfix: Fixed lights drawing power twice
  - balance: Rebalances costs for power consumption of most machinery to ensure lights
      aren't the only things drawing any noticeable power.
  - code_imp: Fixed some instances where machines weren't using the right proc to
      discern if they're in IDLE or ACTIVE power consumption modes.
  - refactor: Refactored emitter code so they have less of a mind of their own and
      actually fire if there is enough power.
  - rscadd: Added a special power draw mechanic to the gravity generator (Since it
      had no power cost to begin with). If it's either powering up or powering down
      it's power use will be 10 times higher than when it is stable.

  - balance: Energy katana dash no longer can go through people, but instead will
      attack and push back the person that you hit.
  - balance: Energy katana can no longer delimb, this has been replaced with delimbing
      strike. An ability that allows the ninja to attack the 3 tiles in front of it,
      deilmbing anyone who gets caught in the attack.
  - balance: Energy katana damage decreased to 22, down from 30.
  - balance: Reduces their armour, particularly against melee attacks.

      rig
  - rscadd: Adds a Gas Rig Shielding power value to each gas
  - tweak: Adjusted maps to fit the new gas rig.

      there makes no sense

  - rscadd: resin mister upgrades can now be applied to the modsuit module
  - bugfix: the resin mister module now deploys
  - refactor: watertank backpacks are more flexible
  ? mrmanlikesbt, MrMelbert, san7890, SuperNovaa41, Watermelon914, lessthnthree, ZephyrTFA,
    Jacquerel, AnywayFarus, imedial, SmArtKar
  : - rscadd: Added the "Vote" verb the OOC tab, here you can check the status of
        current voting or call them if you are able.
    - tweak: Map votes now use a tally system instead of weighted RNG. What this means
        is that votes for the maps that did not win will carry over to the next map
        vote, and when that map eventually wins its tallies will be reset.
    - refactor: refactored the voting subsystem
    - tweak: Slightly altered the Emergency Shuttle undocking announcement
2025-09-15:

      belong to anyone who gives him an expensive luxury dog bone.

      (5066kPa). While a vent is overclocked it will slowly lose integrity which you
      can see via air alarm or examining it, you can repair a vent by using a screwdriver
      on it. As the vent's integrity decreases, the amount of gas it is able to move
      while under normal operation will decrease as well. When the vent reaches 0
      integrity it will break and unwrench itself.
