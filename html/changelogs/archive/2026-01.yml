  : - balance: converted beestation's maintenance loot list into a triple-level weighted
        list. Loot is broken up by tiers and categories. The previous loot list was
        considered for its specific parts, but it should not be expected for the new
        maintenance list to be congruent to it.
    - refactor: defines pick_weight_recursive()
    - code_imp: languages can weight syllables. (Fun fact, Galactic Common uses Mandarin
        Chinese syllables)
    - code_imp: adds support for converting armories to use mapping spawners rather

  RKz:
  - rscadd: 'All drug addictions are now put into 5 categories: Stimulants, Opioids,

      call, now properly interface with the new addiction system.

      based system. It progresses much like disease tiers. Addiction is no longer

      a supermatter delamination on your station.

      than making you intelligible immediately
  - rscadd: adds hereticslurring, rather than copying cultslurring
  rkz, Mothblocks:
  - balance: ashlanders and monkeys are hardcoded via brains to be unable to operate
      mechs
