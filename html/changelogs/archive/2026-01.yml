  PowerfulBacon:
  - bugfix: When performing pierce protection checks, simplified targeting will now
      prefer zones that do not have pierce protection.
  - bugfix: Pierce protection is now performed after selecting a target zone, correcting
      bruise pack/ointment behaviour that either incorrect allowed or rejected healing
      through armour.

      without being connected.

  : - balance: converted beestation's maintenance loot list into a triple-level weighted
        list. Loot is broken up by tiers and categories. The previous loot list was
        considered for its specific parts, but it should not be expected for the new
        maintenance list to be congruent to it.
    - refactor: defines pick_weight_recursive()
    - code_imp: languages can weight syllables. (Fun fact, Galactic Common uses Mandarin
        Chinese syllables)
    - code_imp: adds support for converting armories to use mapping spawners rather
        than manual edits. This PR author would prefer not to step on toes by mass-standardizing
        armories at the moment.
    - admin: Added a config that regulates random spawners weights.
    - bugfix: modsuit maint modules now correctly spawn
    - bugfix: fake nuke disks no longer have the stationloving component, so they
        dont break the atom init anymore
    - rscadd: readds the greytide spear. Its never existed outside of adminspawn,
        which was a contributor to it being removed. It now has a use inside the maint
        pool.

  Isaac:
  - balance: Mech's cells are drained faster from EMP's
  - balance: Mech's receive more damage from EMP's
  - balance: Mech's equipment is disabled for 2x longer when hit by an EMP

  - bugfix: Mice no longer spawn during unit testing, which breaks cable tests.
  - bugfix: Fixes TGUI windows lagging the game when opened until you open the preferences
      screen.
  - bugfix: Eye-stabbing will now always deal the same damage as a regular attack,
      and will perform a regular attack if it fails making it behave better while
      on simplified mode.
  - bugfix: Fixes eye-stabbing having 100% armour penetration.
  RKz:
  - rscadd: 'All drug addictions are now put into 5 categories: Stimulants, Opioids,
      Alcohol, Hallucinogens, and Maintenance Drugs. All narcotics have been given
      a category corresponding to their effect.'
  - bugfix: Narcotics that had clearly addicting effects, yet were missing an addiction
      call, now properly interface with the new addiction system.
  - rscadd: new stats have been added to some chemistry reagents that will help medical
      deal with these new effects. Neurine and Sodium-Thiopetal can be used to alleviate
      seizures from drug abuse.
  - tweak: Completely gutted the "threshold" addiction system in favor of a point
      based system. It progresses much like disease tiers. Addiction is no longer
      some joke noobtrap that just affects your mood, if you partake in a shitton
      of drugs, you will feel the consequences.
  Rukofamicom:
  - bugfix: Loose power cells mapped into stations no longer have unusual capacities
  - rscadd: Maps will now lint against changes to charge and maxcharge variables for

      teleported
  - refactor: cleaned up the antag spawner item's code
  - bugfix: the ghost poll for syndicate reinforcements now have the correct poll
      icon for what is being spawned, previously it would always be the syndicate
      assault cyborg
  mrmanlikesbt, Jacquerel, lessthnthree, SmArtKar:
  - rscadd: Added incident displays. These show how many rounds it has been since
      a supermatter delamination on your station.
  rkz, Melbert:
  - code_imp: drunkeness, dizziness, and speech slurring are now status effects
  - refactor: slurring speech from drunkeness should have much better ramp-up, rather
      than making you intelligible immediately
  - rscadd: adds hereticslurring, rather than copying cultslurring
  rkz, Mothblocks:
  - balance: ashlanders and monkeys are hardcoded via brains to be unable to operate
      mechs
  - code_imp: adds another carbon trait to brains, the ability to strip others with
      the stripping menu
  - code_imp: strip menu unit test
