  r1ks-iwnl:

  Isaac:
  - bugfix: Captain's beret has armor again
  PowerfulBacon:
  - bugfix: When performing pierce protection checks, simplified targeting will now
      prefer zones that do not have pierce protection.

      bruise pack/ointment behaviour that either incorrect allowed or rejected healing
      through armour.

      is pierce proof.
  - tweak: Increases contrast for simplified targeting medical alert icons.

  : - balance: converted beestation's maintenance loot list into a triple-level weighted
        list. Loot is broken up by tiers and categories. The previous loot list was
        considered for its specific parts, but it should not be expected for the new
        maintenance list to be congruent to it.
    - refactor: defines pick_weight_recursive()
    - code_imp: languages can weight syllables. (Fun fact, Galactic Common uses Mandarin
        Chinese syllables)
    - code_imp: adds support for converting armories to use mapping spawners rather
        than manual edits. This PR author would prefer not to step on toes by mass-standardizing
        armories at the moment.
    - admin: Added a config that regulates random spawners weights.
    - bugfix: modsuit maint modules now correctly spawn
    - bugfix: fake nuke disks no longer have the stationloving component, so they
        dont break the atom init anymore
    - rscadd: readds the greytide spear. Its never existed outside of adminspawn,
        which was a contributor to it being removed. It now has a use inside the maint
        pool.
