  Rukofamicom:
  - balance: Apids are now much stronger, but not without weaknesses
  - tweak: Apids no longer take extra burn, toxin or stamina damage. They are now
      take halved toxin damage in fact!
  - tweak: Apids are now 20% resistant to brute damage, their hardened exoskeleton
      providing them some natural defense!
  - tweak: Apid lungs are now much better. If the environment has Oxygen, they can
      probably breathe in it. The lungs offer a modest resistance to plasma and bz
      as well, though these substances are still toxic in large enough quantities.
  - tweak: Apids now have stingers which they can use to inject 10u of apid venom
      once every two minutes. Apid stingers use the same logic as piercing syringes
      meaning they can bypass simple armor, but not thicker materials.
  - rscadd: Apid Venom, which metabolizes very slowly and prevents the wound which
      injected it from closing properly. You can hold the wound with your hands, but
      you will find gauze ineffective at stopping an apid sting from bleeding until
      the venom has been dealt with!
  - tweak: Heparin's bleeding has been increased and it no longer does brute damage.
  - code_imp: add_bleeding() can now be passed a boolean argument so that it can change
      bleeding values without a sound effect
  rkz, MTandi, MrMelbert, JohnFulpWillard, VinylSpiders, Aylong:
  - rscadd: Adds new 3/4ths sprites for Smartfridges
  - rscadd: Smartfridges and Vendors have a new grid UI. The player can swap between
      grid and list UIs in the interface, and in their preferences.
  - rscadd: Smartfridge/Vendors now have a searchbar
  - code_imp: lowers init by generating vending spritesheets with DMIcon where possible
  - bugfix: fixes non-freebie vendors showing costed items as free, while still forcing
      you to pay

  mrmanlikesbt:
  - rscadd: Added a stallout to dynamic midrounds. If dynamic fails to execute a midround
      ruleset it will wait before choosing and then executing another one.
  - tweak: Set the Space Dragon ruleset min player amount to 13
  - bugfix: Admin forced rulesets are properly logged now
