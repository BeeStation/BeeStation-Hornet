  Rukofamicom:
  - balance: Apids are now much stronger, but not without weaknesses
  - tweak: Apids no longer take extra burn, toxin or stamina damage. They are now
      take halved toxin damage in fact!
  - tweak: Apids are now 20% resistant to brute damage, their hardened exoskeleton
      providing them some natural defense!
  - tweak: Apid lungs are now much better. If the environment has Oxygen, they can
      probably breathe in it. The lungs offer a modest resistance to plasma and bz
      as well, though these substances are still toxic in large enough quantities.
  - tweak: Apids now have stingers which they can use to inject 10u of apid venom
      once every two minutes. Apid stingers use the same logic as piercing syringes
      meaning they can bypass simple armor, but not thicker materials.
  - rscadd: Apid Venom, which metabolizes very slowly and prevents the wound which
      injected it from closing properly. You can hold the wound with your hands, but
      you will find gauze ineffective at stopping an apid sting from bleeding until
      the venom has been dealt with!
  - tweak: Heparin's bleeding has been increased and it no longer does brute damage.
  - code_imp: add_bleeding() can now be passed a boolean argument so that it can change
      bleeding values without a sound effect
  rkz, MTandi, MrMelbert, JohnFulpWillard, VinylSpiders, Aylong:
  - rscadd: Adds new 3/4ths sprites for Smartfridges
  - rscadd: Smartfridges and Vendors have a new grid UI. The player can swap between
      grid and list UIs in the interface, and in their preferences.
  - rscadd: Smartfridge/Vendors now have a searchbar
  - code_imp: lowers init by generating vending spritesheets with DMIcon where possible
  - bugfix: fixes non-freebie vendors showing costed items as free, while still forcing
      you to pay
2025-08-03:
  mrmanlikesbt:
  - rscadd: Added a stallout to dynamic midrounds. If dynamic fails to execute a midround
      ruleset it will wait before choosing and then executing another one.
  - tweak: Set the Space Dragon ruleset min player amount to 13
  - bugfix: Admin forced rulesets are properly logged now
2025-08-05:
  Isaac:
  - bugfix: Echo Server Room Overheating due to faulty plasma canister
  - bugfix: Echo Station Kitchen APC not being connected to the station
  PowerfulBacon:
  - tweak: Dynamic midround rulesets can now have multiple severities, meaning that
      it is not limited to only wizards during round ends at low-pops.
  - tweak: Lowers the min pop required for dragon and blob to spawn.
  - tweak: All dynamic midround rulesets are equally weighted.

  Nakalon:
  - bugfix: Fixed Atmospheric external airlock access in Box Station
  mrmanlikesbt, Mothblocks, Bomberman66Dev, san7890:
  - code_imp: modifies the ASSERT() macro
  - code_imp: adds trait helpers for easily adding a list of traits to something
2025-08-07:
  Rukofamicom:
  - tweak: Autotransfer will now trigger automatically once a certain amount of time
      has passed again even with no votes due to players heckling others for using
      the system as intended.
  - tweak: Dead players an antagonists are no longer factored into the calculation
      for how many votes are required to leave. If the number of living non-antagonist
      crew is dwindling, votes to begin a new round should be given a heavier weight
      to offset total antagonist takeover situations.
  TsunamiAnt:
  - rscadd: Added candy dispensers to every station!
  - rscadd: Added syndicate gumballs.
  mrmanlikesbt:
  - bugfix: fixed scientist abductor tools
  rkz, MrMelbert, Arkatos:
  - refactor: refactor changeling antagonist
  - rscadd: changelings now use a radial when swapping bodies
  - rscadd: more features for changeling_profile datums
  - bugfix: You can no longer override the ling DNA you're currently disguised as.
      This was apparently always intended but broken for ages.
2025-08-08:
  Doktorwueue (wueue) and SirYoshimoto:
  - rscadd: Adds crew wearable backpacks in the style of all cyborgs to Cargo, Security,
      Engineering, Medical, Bar, Chef, Botany, Donksoft and Robotics clothes vendors
      for 300cr (Syndicate bags are 350cr). Also available in the Beecoin shop for
      2000 beecoins (syndicate bags are 3500 beecoins for donors only).
  - imageadd: Adds mob, inhand and icon sprites of 10 Cyborg style backpacks.
  Rukofamicom:
  - rscdel: Door charges have been entirely removed from the game code
  - tweak: Instead, any grenade can now be inserted into an open airlock, which will
      cause it to detonate the next time the airlock opens. This is how door charges
      behaved.
  - rscdel: Large chemical grenades have been removed. These were able to hold bluespace
      beakers and slime cores.
  - tweak: All chemical grenades accept xenobio slime cores now.
  - tweak: Chemical payloads no longer require Gibtonite or C4, a simple igniter will
      do now.
  - tweak: Primed grenades will now have a +/- 40% variable fuse timer to reinforce
      their purpose as area denial tools moreso than sudden takedown tools. Cook grenades
      at your peril.
  - bugfix: You will no longer attempt to place C4/X4 that is no longer in your hands
      because you've already done something else with it. This means no more accidentally
      bombing your bag of explosives.
  - balance: Morphs can now see living mobs through walls and while vent crawling,
      better enabling them to set up ambushes.
  - balance: Morphs can now initiate a weaker ambush that doesn't inject venom and
      knocks down for less time by attacking mobs while transformed. This type of
      ambush will flash silicons.
  - balance: Successfully ambushing as a morph, or being attacked while disguised
      will now force the morph out of disguise for at least 20 seconds
  - balance: Morph venom now causes worse confusion in mobs affected by the venom
  - tweak: Morphs can no longer carry humanoid mobs and will instead digest them on
      the spot which is interruptible and takes three seconds. Morphs also no longer
      remove clothing items from humanoids they digest, meaning your suit sensors
      can still locate you.
  - tweak: Ambushes now set the morph on a melee attack cooldown while also stunning
      their target for 1 second, giving victims a brief window to understand they
      have been ambushed before beginning to take damage.
  - tweak: Morphs now do burn damage instead of brute (to represent acidic attacks),
      but the damage dealt is unchanged. This makes the damage they deal to cyborgs
      harder to repair, and also makes them much more threatening to IPCs who are
      immune to the venom effects.
  - tweak: 'Morph movespeed has been reversed: They are now slow when transformed
      and faster when they aren''t. This means they are easier to hit when disguised
      (potentially as something very small), but able to properly pursue targets when
      they aren''t.'
  - tweak: Morphs now heal from anything they can digest, though the healing is limited
      to 50% of their max HP every 2.5 minutes. Eating mobs bypasses this limitation
      on healing.
  - tweak: Morphs are no longer given away by examining suspicious objects, but attacking
      one will break their disguise and prevent them from taking a new one for 20
      seconds. If you have reason to suspect something is a morph, start swinging
      before you get ambushed.
  - rscadd: Morphs now have a status effect to indicate when they are unable to transform
      and for how long
  - tweak: Morphs no longer have a cooldown on disguises except as described above
      in combat oriented situations.
  - balance: Wheelys now have the same speed as skateboards instead of lightspeed.
  - balance: Nitrium move speed buff has been reduced. High and low doses provide
      different boosts now as well, but both are lower than the old speed.
  - balance: Nitrium is no longer fatal in any capacity when misused, making it the
      safest available speed boosting "drug".
  - balance: Nitrium no longer gives damage slowdown immunity, but has retained all
      other immunities.
  - tweak: Nitrium stops restoring stamina after a certain point, and instead starts
      to inflict stamina damage. This is indicated by the messages "Your body aches!"
      or "Your body feels like it's on fire!" when you are under the effects. (Note
      that nitrium still offers stamina crit immunity so you will never accidentally
      fall into stamcrit making you unable to switch your internals off)
  - tweak: Nitrium is now highly addicting and has an overdose threshold. These do
      not mechanically punish players and serve only as flavor and a clear warning
      respectively.
  TsunamiAnt:
  - code_imp: dynamic point deltas are now (5,-5) not (10,-10)
2025-08-09:
  Nakalon:
  - tweak: IPC brains now fit inside Robotic Torsos
  - tweak: A warning message will appear when attempting to fit an IPC brain inside
      a body which already has a brain (even if elsewhere)
  - rscadd: A new surgery called Identity Recalibration can be preformed on robotic
      torsos! (You'll need an ID)
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug stopping players from downloading programs that had a hardware
      requirement
  - tweak: CE and Atmos PDAs start with a micro area recharger for compatibility with
      the Power Monitor app.
  - tweak: Atmos role disk was given the Power Monitor app.
  - refactor: Refactored my own ass code to ensure this bug doesn't happen ever again.
  - rscadd: You now get 40 beecoins at roundstart after readying up.
  - bugfix: Fixes a bug causing qdeled modular computers to drop parts
  Rukofamicom:
  - bugfix: Diona no longer need to breathe at any time, instead of only being freed
      of this burden as a nymph
  mrmanlikesbt, LemonInTheDark, ninjanomnom:
  - code_imp: shifted around some signal logic
  - code_imp: micro optimizations for signal code

  : - rscadd: modsuits
    - tweak: all ERT have been converted to use modsuits
    - tweak: all antagonists that had hardsuits (Nukies, Spacewizard, Uplink Traitors)
        have been converted to use modsuits
    - rscadd: adds a loader modsuit for cargo to use. It is not spaceproof and has
        very little module support, but is good for hauling crates
    - code_imp: adds unit test to confirm all outfits apply correctly
    - rscdel: deletes antagonist, ERT, and head of staff hardsuits
    - refactor: refactored wizard casting to check a clothing flag, instead of a var
    - tweak: captain's backpack now fits on both MODsuits & suit storage slots
    - bugfix: fixes spellcards targeting. Revamps lockon component.
    - rscadd: adds infiltrator kit, a modsuit that hides your species mutantorgans
        like wings and antennae, with superior armor, normal runspeed and silent footsteps,
        in exchange for no spaceproofing.
    - refactor: refactors ninja gear to all use modsuit modules
2025-08-10:
  Aramix:
  - bugfix: mail now spawns at the intended rate (max 1/minute at 5+ pop, with crate
      still being limited to 6-12 mails)
  TsunamiAnt:
  - rscadd: Engineering now has oxycandles in the engie-vend
  - tweak: Hellfire candles are now cheaper.
