  - rscadd: Adds new 3/4ths sprites for Smartfridges

      grid and list UIs in the interface, and in their preferences.
  - rscadd: Smartfridge/Vendors now have a searchbar
  - code_imp: lowers init by generating vending spritesheets with DMIcon where possible
  - bugfix: fixes non-freebie vendors showing costed items as free, while still forcing
      you to pay
