      Vendor when examining it

      Press the button and toss the capsule and watch as it expands into a tall storage
      device. Close it to shrink it back into a pocket-sized capsule. Has the same
      capacity as a normal crate but cannot hold bulky items or most mobs (Tiny mobs
      like mice will fit inside).
  - rscadd: Added the ability to pick up most bots such as beepsky and medibots by

      very sudden surprise attacks utilizing bot deployments.

      be toggled between a deployable form that is carried around and "deployed" form
      that is interactable within the environment'
  - refactor: Refactored body bags and roller beds to be subtypes of deployable mentioned
      above. There should be no functional difference in how these items behave.

      no longer grenades and are instead collapsible barriers now. The barriers may
      only be dismantled after being unlocked by swiping an ID with security clearance.
  - tweak: The amount of security barriers available at roundstart and within cargo
      orders has been roughly doubled because they are now always deployed one.
  - tweak: Sandbags and wooden barricades can now be recollected as well by dragging
      them onto the user's sprite. Damage sustained to these barricades affects their
      return yield when picked up.

      die in lava
  - refactor: cleaned up movement_delay
  - balance: Consequently, carbon movement will no longer be interrupted or delayed
      by an initial attack. While a longtime feature, this is actually the result
      of a bug. This will lower an already strong advantage an aggressor usually has
      in a combat situation, and should even the playing field. Slowdown due to overall
      damage to the carbon is not affected.
