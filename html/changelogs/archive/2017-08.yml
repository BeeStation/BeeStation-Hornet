  - bugfix: Fixed corgis being able to wear spacesuit helmets despite lacking the
      proper code and sprites for them.
  Joan:
  - tweak: Colossus's shotgun is now a static-spread blast of 6 bolts, making it more
      predictable.
  - balance: Geis now mutes for 12-14 seconds and "stuns" the target, via a binding
      effect, for 25 seconds instead of initiating a conversion.
  - experiment: Geis's "stun" restrains the target and prevents them from taking actions,
      but its duration is halved if the binding is not being pulled by a Servant.
  - wip: Using Geis on a target prevents you from taking actions other than attempting
      to pull the binding. If you are pulling the binding, you can dispel it at any
      time.
  - wip: As should be obvious, if the binding is destroyed or dispelled, you can once
      again take normal actions.
  - tweak: Sigils of Submission are now permanent and have been moved from the Script
      tier to the Driver tier, with an according cost adjustment. They still do not

  Joan:
  - balance: Geis bindings no longer decay faster if not pulled by a Servant, but
      last for 20 seconds, from 25.
  - tweak: Geis bindings will decay slower when on a Sigil of Submission, and, if
      being pulled by a Servant when crossing a Sigil of Submission, will helpfully
      remove the pull.
  - tweak: Removing Geis bindings is no longer instant and can be done by any Servant
      with a slab, not just the initiator.
  - wip: Geis no longer prevents you from taking actions, but you remain unable to
      recite scripture while the target is bound. In addition, dealing damage to a
      bound target will cause the bindings to decay much more rapidly.
  - rscadd: You can now remove sigils by hitting them with a clockwork slab for a
      small refund.
  More Robust Than You:
