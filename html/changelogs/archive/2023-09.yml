      that same virus previously.
  - tweak: You no longer have to click on an exact sprite to scan or extract a virus
      from something with the viral extrapolator - if you click on something that
      doesn't have any valid diseases (such as a floor tile), you will instead scan/extract

      multiple things on the tile, you can choose which one to scan from a popup)

      than being completely silent except for the beep afterwards.

      least one level 9 symptom in its freebie virus.

  Absolucy, Pirill, Aramix:
  - rscadd: Almost completely reworked holoparasites.
  - rscadd: New holoparasite major ability, Dextrous, which allows the holoparasite
      to hold and use items, in additional to having a single internal storage slot.
      However, Dextrous holoparasites have limitations on being able to use guns or
      two-handed weapons, and they rely on weapons in order to do notable damage,
      as their punches are weak.
  - rscadd: New holoparasite minor ability, Telepathy. It's exactly what it says on
      the tin.
  - rscadd: New holoparasite minor ability, Babeltongue. It allows your holoparasite

      akin to a pAI with the universal translator, or the curator.
  - rscadd: New holoparasite minor ability, Radio Noise. It allows your holoparasite
      (only the holopara, not the summoner) to hear most radio channels (except Centcom
      and Syndicate).

  - rscadd: 'Reworked the melee/ranged system for holoparasites into a ''weapons''
      system, with 3 main weapons being offered for them: Punch, Ranged, and Bladed.'

      recoil damage if the holoparasite taking damage can actually be seen within
      range of the summoner.
  - tweak: Brute and burn damage absorbed by holoparasites now transfer 'properly'
      to the summoner, rather than all damage being transformed into brute.
  - tweak: The movement speed of holoparasites is now affected by their Speed stat.
  - rscdel: Removed requiem holoparasites. As with stand arrows, they were nigh-unobtainable
      anyways, and there was literally only one requiem ability left in the code.
