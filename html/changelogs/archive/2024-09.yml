2024-09-01:
  Aramix:
  - tweak: pacified all pets spawned by Xenobiology's Stabilized Gold
  MarkusLarsson421:
  - bugfix: Fixed so that Efficiency Law board can be printed.
  - tweak: Changed the name of the Crewsimov board from "Default" to "Crewsimov".
  Penwin0:
  - bugfix: Plague Doctor hat no longer covers the face and doesn't look like a biohood
      when held.
  PowerfulBacon:
  - rscadd: Adds in a new mapping helper for mapping disposal networks.
  XeonMations:
  - tweak: Bodybags can no longer be heirlooms.
  - tweak: Medical flashlight pens, scalpels and suit sensors can now be heirlooms.

  - bugfix: Fixes a bunch of mapping issues with CorgStation
  Rukofamicom, Fikou:
  - rscadd: Concussive gauntlets have arrived! Shaft miners will find that the diamond
      pickaxe can no longer be found in tendril chests, and instead they may find
      concussive gauntlets!
  - tweak: Tumor shards will now poll ghosts for control of lavaland elites if the
      original player has left the body. There is still no guarantee of having a new
      pet if alternatives are not available.
  - tweak: Gibtonite fuses are no longer variable so that miners with good timing
      are more consistently rewarded for risking life and limb to try and defuse it.
  - balance: PKA modkits have been standardized to cost either 0%, 25%, or 50% capacity.
      This means it is now possible to utilize 100% of the weapon's potential and
      up to four impactful mods may now be installed!
  - balance: PKA modkits that do AoE damage have had their power doubled, but still
      have an upper limit of 80% normal power. It is now far more practical to install
      AoE damage mods, but will still weaken the power of the weapon overall in exchange
      for versatility.
  - balance: Damage increasing modkits have had their power halved. This was overlooked
      during the major lavaland rebalance that halved the HP of all fauna and halved
      the damage of mining tools. Damage modkits are supposed to increase damage by
      25% of base power, not 50%.
  - tweak: All modkits are now compatible with mine bots, and the special cooldown
      reduction mod has been removed since the normal cooldown mod works on them now.
      Mine bots have the same capacity for mods as a PKA.
  - tweak: 'Explorer webbing can now hold additional mining tools and items: shovel,
      survival knife, emergency oxygen tank, PKA and plasma cutters. It can no longer
      hold kitchen knives.'
  - code_imp: Cleaned up some variable names and unnecessary code within the kinetic_accelerator
      file.

  Rukofamicom:
  - tweak: Players are no longer limited to a single positronic brain per round.
  - tweak: Cyborgs may no longer have duplicate names, unless they are being rebuilt
      from the same brain that was previously a cyborg - if you are respawning as
      a fresh cyborg and do not choose a different character profile first, you will
      be given the default cyborg name instead of becoming a second copy of the same
      cyborg.
  - bugfix: Service borg glasses and graspers are no longer covered in industrial
      glue and can actually be used to serve drinks again
  - tweak: Service and Medical cyborgs can now synthesize standard, 50u drinking glasses
      and beakers respectively with their graspers. Simply use their grasping tool
      with nothing in it to produce one.
  - tweak: Medical and service cyborgs can both hold a much wider variety of reagent
      containers now
  - tweak: Service cyborgs can now synthesize a wider variety of drinks instead of
