      (we need our code to actually work in a unit test)
  - bugfix: cleans up 'repeating' surgeries. Surgeries will try to repeat as a default
      behavior if they fail at first (like using a kitchen knife as a scalpel for

  VmpOS2NHSkhkejA9:
  - balance: Motorized wheelchair speed has been rebalanced, they can go up to normal
      run speed at t3 parts without risk of crashing, and can go even faster than
      regular humans if T4 parts are used and the safeties are overridden with a multitool,
      at the risk (or bonus, if you see it that way) of crashing violently if they
      bump into anything.
  - tweak: Examining motorized wheelchairs gives a more accurate view of their speed,
      power consumption and shows what tools can be used on them.
  - tweak: Motorized wheelchairs consume less power with T1 parts, but consume slightly
      more than before at T4.
  - bugfix: Motorized wheelchairs consume the correct amount of power when moving,
      and no longer consume power when dragged, along with no longer causing countless
      runtimes when dragged around without a cell. They also no longer spam the chat
      when they are missing a power cell or are simply out of charge.
  - bugfix: Motorized wheelchairs spawned on maps or by admins are now fully functional,
      albeit with only T1 parts.
  XeonMations:

  ClownMoff:
  - tweak: 'Corgstation: Gave the kitchen and bar a more modern look and added some
      more doors'
  - bugfix: fixed monkeys not using their icon on StrongDMM
  PowerfulBacon:
  - tweak: The job assignment algorithm has been changed to prioritise statistical
      randomness for players with many job roles enabled, over ensuring that head
      and security positions are filled. Selecting all jobs to medium ensures that
      you have the same probability of rolling any job, while setting all jobs to
      low means that you will get the jobs which other players did not select.
  - tweak: If the round starts with less than 7 players online, then all but the captain,
      shaft miner and basic department jobs will be disabled and these roles will
      be given access to their entire department.
  - tweak: If the roundstarts with less than 14 players online, some non-important
      job roles will be disabled.
  - tweak: Skeleton crew access is now based on job presence rather than population.
  - tweak: There are now unlimited job slots for medical doctors, security officers,
      engineerings, cargo technicians and scientists but for these slots to be open
      requires there to be at most a difference of 2 between the most and least populated
      of these jobs.
  VmpOS2NHSkhkejA9:
  - tweak: honeycombs are food, they must be ground up to get their reagents now.
  - bugfix: honeycombs no longer shatter into glass when thrown
  rkz, Jacquerel, tralezab, seris02, LemonInTheDark, itseasytosee, Capybara Holly, MrMelbert, vinylspiders:
  - rscadd: Monkeys will play songs if handed instruments
  - refactor: Refactored monkey AI trees
  - code_imp: replaced a lot of var usages that were resulting in harddels with weakrefs
  - bugfix: Monkeys will no longer attack with items worse than their basic bite
  - refactor: Datum AI can now switch to different movement datums in their behavior

  - bugfix: mindless bodies can once again be body-only scanned in the clone scanner
      instead of causing a runtime error
  Nakalon:
  - tweak: Stripping a mob now puts the item in the strippers hands
  Rukofamicom:
  - balance: Hand restraints such as handcuffs are now much simpler to break out of.
      Each attempt takes only five seconds and gives a miniscule chance of breaking
      out immediately if you get lucky with a compounding chance after each attempt.
      Each attempt stacks up to eventually being enough to guarantee the cuffs are
      removed once your total attempts are equal to the breakout time as well.
  - balance: Attempts to remove any types of restraint (Bola, cuffs, straight jackets,
      etc.) no longer require you to be still and motionless, which means you can
      run around like a headless chicken and still break out of some cuffs. Being
      dragged in circles by an officer no longer interrupts breakout attempts either.
  - balance: Because the general process for breaking hand restraints is now much
      more consistent, the base times for all three hand restraints has been increased
      dramatically so that handcuffs are still effective at their intended purpose,
      just without being an indefinite restraint.
  - tweak: Buckle-cuffed players are able to remove their restraints first now, so
      buckling a player who is cuffed does nothing to lengthen the effective restraint
      time further, it only prevents them from running around.
  - tweak: straight jackets take two minutes to break out of instead of five now,
      because five is an excessive amount of time to potentially stack on top of cuffs.
  - tweak: Xenomorphs can no longer instantly break cuffs. They use the same define
      and code as hulks do, taking five seconds to break the cuffs. In both hulk and
      xeno cases, the cuffs can now be broken while moving.
  marshmellow10:
  - bugfix: fixes resist

      a white box and looked old should be cooler looking now). Notable examples include:
      the hand teleporter list, the spawn command, a lot of admin secret buttons,
      brain washing, some security consoles, blood cultist teleport runes, law consoles,
      pen rotation, slime feeding target list, comms console announcement, some ghost

  - tweak: Raised the size of the largest battery (and others) and raised the max
      hardware size on laptops
  - tweak: components are now repairable with a welder instead of cable coil

      up to 40u. High reward rule of cool payoff for those that want to gamble on
      a 65% chance.
  - tweak: Poisoned knife now delivers 1/3 of its intended payload to targets that
      are protected from injection (Previously this was 1u regardless of intended
      injection amount)

  Rukofamicom:
  - balance: Tackling gloves are less effective against targets in combat mode and/or
      targets with throw enabled and have a higher variance when it comes to the RNG
      roll that determines the outcome of an attempted tackle.
  - balance: Tackling gloves are less effective at targets with no damage (real or
      stamina) and more effective as their health goes down.

      positive bonus they nearly guaranteed a positive outcome.
