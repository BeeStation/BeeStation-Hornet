      crushers can apply multiple marks to different targets! Marks applied may eventually
      expire if not detonated.

      that is very bulky and has a very low rate of fire. Gang members can buy this

      of bullets with an extended view range. It does not run out of ammo, but a significant
      delay between volleys and its stationary nature leaves the gunner vulnerable
      to flanking and return fire. Holding down the trigger will allow you to aim
      the gun while firing. It will cost gangs 50 influence.
  - rscadd: The sawn-off improvised shotgun is now available to gangs for 6 influence.
      With buckshot shells being easy to produce or purchase, this gun gives the most
