      organs that are currently failing, however.
  - rscadd: Lobectomy! Not lobotomy, but cuts out a damaged lung lobe to make its
      performance passable. Restores a lung to working order if it was too damaged
      to work before, but can only be done once. The lobectomy step has a 95% chance
      of success, so use some form of sterilizer to ensure you don't accidentally
      get blood inside your patient's lungs!
  - rscadd: Coronary Bypass! Restores a heart to working order if it was too damaged
      to work before, but can only be done once. Both incising the heart and grafting
      the bypass have a 90% chance to succeed, and failing them will cause heart damage
      and massive amounts of bleeding- so be sure to work with ideal conditions, proper
      tools, and sterilizer!

      cause it to burst if left untreated
  - tweak: Organs heal faster the healthier the host is
  - balance: Defib timer has been extended to 15 minutes! Now cloning has a decent
      alternative. All you have to do is heal or replace failing organs e.g. mannitol
      on the brain, coronary bypass for the heart etc.
  - balance: formaldehyde prevents post mortem organ decay.
  - balance: epinepherine pens now contain 3u formaldehyde preservative.
