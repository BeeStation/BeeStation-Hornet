  - rscdel: Removed an offensive word from the list of phobia trigger words.
  RKz, ShizCalev:

      anchored var directly. This means that COMSIG_MOVABLE_SETANCHORED can now actually
      be used reliably to track if an object's anchored var has changed.
  - bugfix: The refactor also means that varediting the anchored var will now properly
      update most items' other states that rely on it being set a certain way.

      given at roundstart.
  - rscdel: dermagraphic ovulogenesis symptom
  - tweak: while virus customization is disabled, virus sample crates instead ship
      5 isolated utility symptoms
  - rscadd: re-adds viro zombies. They're now weaker, and only spread their diseases,
      instead of spreading the tumor itself.
  - rscadd: adds a new chemical reaction, which allows you to remove faltered, immutable,
      dormant, and carrier status from viruses
  - balance: random viruses made through events should be more impactful now
  - balance: some symptom thresholds should be far easier to reach. config controlled.
  - tweak: toxoplasmosis sapiens is now level 0, and can *technically* appear, but,
      like all level 0 symptoms, will practically never appear, and will be even less
      likely to have any significant effect. However, the owo speak effect has been
      substantially toned down, and should now only impede the speech of certain letters
      and induce random cat noises, rather than replacing words arbitrarily.
