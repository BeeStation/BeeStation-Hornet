  actioninja\memager:

      Speaking of which...'

  - rscadd: 'New disability: Acid flesh. Pockets of acid bubble beneath your skin.
      They will occasionally pop, coating you with acid. This will melt clothes and
      deal damage to you.'
  - rscadd: 'New disability: Spatial Instability. You will randomly teleport, similar
      to a wizard''s blink teleport. This is a very nauseating process, and will inevitably

      objectives have been removed from the mode.'
  - tweak: Powers have been reorganized and are now unlocked in batches every five
      vessels. This gives hosts more power from the get-go and gives them distinct
      phases due to each batch affecting a specific area of the host's ability.
  - tweak: The psychic link pinpointer now starts off with very little time for hosts
      and must be strengthened by using Network Invasion. Each time a host is detected
      via NI, they can be tracked for an extra 30 seconds, and every successful use
      of NI increases the duration of all tracking by 10 seconds. A successful use
      of a new power, Reclaim, also increases the duration of all tracking by 30 seconds.

      random vessels into antagonists with a single, customizable objective.
  - rscadd: 'Circadian Shift is a late-game power that sends everybody in sight to
      sleep for up to almost a minute. The more people affected, the less time it
      lasts, the minimum being eight seconds. remove: Mass Assimilation has been removed
      as Reclaim now fills its role.'

      after assimilation.

  - tweak: The antag limit has been upped from 6 to 9

  - balance: Induce Panic and Distortion Field have been buffed to be more reliable,
      especially at lower hive sizes.
  - balance: 'Induce Panic and Circadian Shift can affect silicons but no longer affect
      hivemind hosts. experimental: A new endgame has been added. The One Mind that
