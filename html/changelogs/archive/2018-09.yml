      force and resist of 100, and a pull force of 101. Things take (resist - force)
      damage when bumped into experimental; Failing to move onto a tile will now still
      bump up your last move timer. However, successfully pushing something out of
      your way will result in you automatically moving into where it was.'

      as Hivemind Hosts, have appeared onboard the station and must assimilate as
      many crew members as possible. Assimilated crew serve as vessels for the Host
      to use their powers through (and on), and as a Host gains vessels, they gain
      new abilities. remove: Vessels are not antagonists. Assimilation does not convert
      crew in any way.'
  - rscadd: Assimilated crewmembers can escape this nightmare by either getting a
      mindshield implant or by dying. Mindshielding vessels will reveal the identity
      of whoever assimilated them. Mindshielded crew are initially protected, but
      should a Host get strong enough, they can break these implants with ease.
  - rscadd: Nothing is stopping Hosts from working together, but as their hives grow,
      so does the incentive to backstab. At 8 vessels, Hosts can probe the minds of
      crew and discover the identity of any other Hosts who have assimilated them,
      and at 18, they can steal every single vessel from a captured enemy Host.
