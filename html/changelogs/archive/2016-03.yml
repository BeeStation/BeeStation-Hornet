      you to choose which to reset.
  - tweak: Resetting a holoparasite also resets its color and name, to make it more
      obvious it's a new player.
  - rscadd: Holoparasites can now see their summoner's health and various ability
      cooldowns from the status panel.

  RemieRichards:
  - rscadd: Added the ability to make Apiaries and Honey frames with wood
  - rscadd: Added the ability to make Royal Bee Jelly from 10 Mutagen and 40 Honey
  - rscadd: Added the ability to make more Queen Bees from Royal Bee Jelly by using
      it on an existing Queen, to split her into two Queens
  - tweak: Made homeless bees more obvious
  - bugfix: Fixed a typo that made almost all bees homeless, severely reducing the
      odds of getting honeycomb
  - tweak: Made bee progress reports (50% towards new honeycomb, etc.) always show,
      even if it's 0%
  - tweak: Made some feedback text more obvious

  Ricotez:
  - imageadd: The default white ghost form now has directional sprites.
  - rscadd: The default white ghost form now also has (your) hair! Here's how it works.
  - experiment: If you ghost from a body, you'll get the hair from that body. If it
      has hair.
  - experiment: If you hit Observe, you'll get the hair from the character you had
      active in your setup window. If they had hair.
  - wip: This only works with the default white ghost form right now (because the
      other forms have the wrong shape or lack directional sprites), and with human
      bodies since they're the only ones that have hair. Sorry lizards and plasmamen!
      You'll get your turn next time.
  - rscadd: A new preference called Ghost Accessories. This lets you configure if
      you want your ghost sprite to show both hair and directional sprites, only directional
      sprites or just use its original default version without directional sprites.
  - rscadd: 'A new preference called Ghosts of Others. This preference is clientside
      and lets you configure how other ghosts appear to you: as their own setting,
      as the form they chose but without any hair or directional sprites, or as the
      simple white ghost sprite if you''re sick of those premium users with their
      rainbow ghosts.'
  - experiment: The layout of the ghost preference buttons has slightly changed. The
      old Choose Ghost Form and Choose Ghost Orbit are now a part of Ghost Customization,
      which also contains the new Ghost Accessories button. Clicking Ghost Customization
      will send you directly to Ghost Accessories if you don't have premium. The Preferences
      tab now also contains the Ghost Display button, which lets you configure how
      other ghosts appear to you.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where the toggles for Ghost Accessories and Ghosts of Others
      in the Preferences menu wouldn't save your preference update to your save file.
  - bugfix: Renamed the "Ghost Display Settings" preference toggle button to "Ghosts
      of Others", so it fits with the name the preference has everywhere else.
  TehZombehz:
  - rscadd: Paper sacks are now craftable by tablecrafting with 5 sheets of paper.
  - rscadd: 'Comes in 5 different designs: Use a pen on a paper sack to change the
