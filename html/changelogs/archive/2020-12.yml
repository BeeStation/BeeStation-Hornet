  Ruko, Isy232:
  - balance: Styptic powder, Synthflesh and Silver Sulf now do nothing when splashed.
  - balance: Styptic powder and Silver Sulf now do 0.5 healing per tick and 1 when
      instantly applied but their OD threshold is upped to 100u and the metabolism
      rate is increased to 1u per tick. A 40 Styptic powder patch will heal 40 to
      the limb it is applied to and then 20 damage over 40 ticks. They also do stamina
      damage equal to the amount applied x2, the medicine is painful so this is pain
      damage.
  - balance: Atropine's brute, toxin and fire damage healing is doubled and it only
      looses its effectiveness at 80 damage instead of critical condition. Atropine
      also now causes dropping of items in its confusion state so its no longer suitable
      for combat use and its overdose threshold is lowered to 15u. Overdosinng on
      atropine now causes atropine to become histamine in a 2 to 3 reaction.
  - balance: Bicardine, Kelotane, Dexalin and Anti-toxin now heal 1.5 per tick while
      below 50 damage and 0.5 per tick when above 50 damage. This makes them no longer
      as effective on large wounds but they are quite capable of healing smaller ones.
      Their metabolism rate has also been halved so they stick around longer.
  - balance: Salicyclic acid, Dexalin Plus and Oxandrolone now heal 3 damage per tick.
      They also do 2 stamina damage per tick up to 80. They now only do stamina damage
      while healing.
  - balance: Anti-toxin no longer purges chems and only heals toxin damage. Use charcoal
      or something.
  - balance: The overdose of most chems now causes organ damage instead of just reversing
      the effects of what the chem healed.
  - rscadd: Adds bicaridine/kelotane pill bottles to burn/brute treatment kits.
  - balance: Brute and burn patches now contain 30u of their reagents instead of only
      20.
  - balance: Perfluorodecalin now causes more toxin damage as a side effect, overdoses
      at 30u and causes lung damage upon overdose.
  - balance: Salbutamol can now cause an overdose. The threshold is 25u (I made salbutamol
      pills have less u to avoid OD on them). This overdose causes Sulbutamol to become
      histamine in a 1 to 1 reaction.
  - balance: Corazone now heals the heart by 1.5 per tick, however it now has an overdose
      threshold at 20u and if you overdose it will turn into histamine in a 1to 1
      reaction.
  - balance: Carthatoline now heals 3 toxin loss per tick and its OD causes brain
      damage. Its overdose threshold is now 25u.
  - balance: Leporazine now has an overdose at 30u. This overdose causes your temperature
      to rapidly increase or decrease randomly.
  - rscadd: You can now find bicaridine and kelotane pill bottles in medical vendors.
