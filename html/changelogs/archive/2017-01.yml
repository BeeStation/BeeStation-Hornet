  - rscadd: Nanotrasen supports the arts. We now offer picture frames!
  coiax:
  - rscdel: The Syndicate "Uplink Implant" now has no TC precharged. You can charge
      it with the use of physical telecrystals. The price has been reduced from 14TC
      to 4TC accordingly. (The uplink implant in the implant bundle still has 10TC).
  - rscadd: Syndicate bombs and nuclear devices now have a minimum timer of 90 seconds.
  - rscadd: Camoflaged HUDs given to head revolutionaries now function the same as
      chameleon glasses in the chameleon kit bundle, giving them an action button
      and far more disguise options.
  - rscadd: Syndicate thermals are also now more like chameleon glasses as well.
  - rscadd: You can regain a use of a soapstone by erasing one of your own messages.
      (This means you can remove a message if you don't like the colour and want to
      try rephrasing it to get a better colour). Erasing someone else's message still
      uses a charge.
  - bugfix: Fixes bugs where you'd spend a charge without engraving anything.
  - bugfix: Fixes a bug where the wrong ckey was entered in the engraving, you won't
      be able to take advantage of the "recharging" on messages made before this change.
