delete-after: true
changes:
  - tweak: Chaplains now come with their null rods and armor beacons
  - tweak: Null rods have been removed from the hidden chapel locations across maps,
      and the chaplain's armaments beacons have been removed from ChapDrobes.
  - bugfix: Newly spawned null rods can be reskinned and newly spawned holy armor
      beacons actually work (instead of deleting themselves).
