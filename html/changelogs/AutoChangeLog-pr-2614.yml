changes:
  - bugfix: "no more with exponential thermal energy, fusion now correctly produces\
      \ heat: supply plasma to your nuclear fusion 'reactor', dammit!"
  - balance: in an attempt to preserve fun, I tweaked some numbers and logics in fusion
      to create some healthy fun
  - rscdel: e30 fusion
  - balance: rad now scales with fusion temperature, which means that you will get
      meager rads if you are bad at fusion (e.g. canister fusion), or stronger rads
      than before if you manage to keep a strong and robust fusion
  - rscadd: in order to help you gauge the strength of your fusion, fusion-derived
      nuclear particles (aka radballs) are color-coded; and adjective-coded, so you
      can also gauge how damned you are after being hit by a radball
  - refactor: lightly refactored fusion code in general
