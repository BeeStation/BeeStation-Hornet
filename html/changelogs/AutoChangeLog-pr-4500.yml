changes:
  - refactor: 'Refactors embedding:'
  - refactor: Using a hemostat allows you to remove embedded items with no damage
      applied.
  - refactor: 'You can now remove embeds from other people ghetto style: Using a screwdriver
      allows you to remove small and tiny embedded items with an 80% success rate,
      and using wirecutters allows you to pull out normal, small or tiny embedded
      items with a 50% success rate.'
  - refactor: Embeds no longer apply damage constantly, instead they will apply damage
      until you go under their damage limit (Essentially creating the effect of lowering
      maxhealth while applied, but alone will not out right kill you).
  - refactor: Embedded items no longer deal damage when they embed, the impact from
      the object damages anyway.
  - refactor: Embeds are blocked by armour, wearing armour reduced the chance of an
      embed embedding into you. If you have more armour than the embed limit, the
      embed will fall off, If you have less but still have armour the probability
      of the embed failing will be decreased linearly proportional to the amount of
      armour you have.
