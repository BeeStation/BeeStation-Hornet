changes:
  - balance: Super energy chainsaw damage reduced to 45, roughly fully kills you in
      5 hits, 3 to crit
  - balance: Energy Shield Module HP reduced to 30
  - bugfix: Chainsaws turn themselves off when dropped on the ground, preventing cases
      where the damage was reset to 0 when dropped
