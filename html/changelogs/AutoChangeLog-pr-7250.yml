changes:
  - refactor: refactored job chat color system to make it following a hud state than
      a job title. as a result of this, some variables are removed. chat color is
      now stored in `_DEFINES/jobs.dm` rather than each job dm files.
  - rscadd: custom jobs now have their own chat color (based on a hud their card has)
  - tweak: adjusted horrible readability of revenant's dark blue chat color in dark
      theme chat mode
  - refactor: some consistent coding in previous custom job title PR to reflect new
      ones
  - refactor: procs in "_defines/jobs.dm" are moved to "_helpers/jobs.dm"
