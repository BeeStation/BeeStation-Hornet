changes:
  - tweak: Cargo stock is now limited and now replenishes supply over time. You can
      no longer mass purchase large quanitites of the same item in a short period
      of time.
  - balance: Reduces amount of starting medkits in medical
  - balance: Reduces amount of starting weapons in armoury
  - tweak: Sleeper is no longer capable of producing chemicals. It needs beakers from
      chemistry in order to function. Sleepers will display the name of the dominant
      chem inside beakers, so you can get creative and hide poisons inside it.
  - tweak: Sleeper upgrades improve injection efficiency. (5 units used for every
      10 units injected)
  - code_imp: Moved some supply related variables away from SSshuttle and into the
      new supply subsystem.
  - balance: The station now starts with 50000 credits instead of 25000 distributed.
      This means that each budget will start with ~6000 credits instead of ~3000
