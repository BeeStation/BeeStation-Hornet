changes:
  - tweak: xeno queens can smack the emergency shuttle console to clear the xeno hostile
      environment rather than waiting it out
  - tweak: Xeno queens will delay the escape shuttle for a while unless they are killed
  - tweak: the shuttle will get auto called at the end of the timer if the queen is
      alive and it hasn't been called already to prevent super xeno extended rounds
