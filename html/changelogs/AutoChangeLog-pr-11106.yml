changes:
  - balance: Replaces PTSDs with service pistols, a less-lethal officer's pistol that
      fires rounds which burn and disable a target simultaneously. It has 10 shots
      and is reloaded via a magazine that can be recharged.
  - bugfix: Fixes weapon rechargers not showing the charge amount of inserted rechargable
      magazines.
