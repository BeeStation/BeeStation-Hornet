changes:
  - rscadd: Adds combat mode
  - rscadd: Adds martial art combo meters and TGUI guides
  - refactor: refactors CanUseTopic and dexterity
  - refactor: refactored syringe code to use flags
  - tweak: clicking on the turf of a airlock while combat mode is off will now close
      the airlock. No more pixel hunting!
  - balance: buffs to hook shotgun in addition to rclick functionality
  - code_imp: renames RemoveComponent, component destroy will no longer runtime when
      parent is null
  - refactor: refactored simple rotation component
  - bugfix: fixed abandoned crates to not try to kill you if you perform actions on
      them AFTER they are unlocked
  - code_imp: introduced variable weapon attack speed. No weapon utilizes this yet
      but admins can now varedit items to attack faster/slower.
  - code_imp: unit tests reagent container transfer amounts
  - code_imp: unit tests attacking people
  - balance: Using Jaunts will conceal your runechat for their duration.
  - code_imp: passed IS_HERETIC through the proc, rather than checking everytime you
      used a heretic spell. Less runtimes.
  - bugfix: cutting wires while a TGUI menu is open will no longer shock you and bypass
      shock protection
  - tweak: cleaned up airlock prying code. Nightmare blades are now crowbars and fulfill
      tool_acts, they still can break stuff by being on combat mode though. Rclick
      with a one to pry regardless of intent.
  - refactor: refactors stun batons
  - tweak: abductor batons are children of stun batons
