changes:
  - rscadd: You can now see if a limb is disabled through checkhealth (HUD, healthanalyzer,
      ghostscan)
  - tweak: being limbless while flying will never apply the limbless slowdown (because
      you are movin just fine, right?)
  - bugfix: minor stamina fixes in the way it is applied & healed
  - code_imp: kills a lot of unecessary limb updating
  - code_imp: makes Limb removal & disabling event-based. Extricate it from update_mobility
