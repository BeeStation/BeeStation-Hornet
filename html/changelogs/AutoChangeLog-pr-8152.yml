changes:
  - tweak: Dynamic now classifies Abductors as a light midround ruleset, allowing
      them to spawn earlier in the round instead of right near the end, as well as
      allowing it to spawn alongside other light rulesets.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug with Syndicate Sleeper Agent not properly updating its candidates.
