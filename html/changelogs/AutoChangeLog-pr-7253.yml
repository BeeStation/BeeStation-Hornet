changes:
  - tweak: adjusted ghost role spawn character's ID card as it doesn't show grey hud
      icon. (CentCom commander, Official, etc)
  - tweak: PDA now has a clickable link to turn on/off PDA auto-update. As long as
      it's On, PDA is automatically updated when it takes a card (Chameleon PDA still
      should do a manual update when you change appearance.)
  - bugfix: Ruin VIP's card gets their owner's name now.
