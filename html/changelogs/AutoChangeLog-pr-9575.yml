changes:
  - tweak: adds sound falloff to several sounds that sorely needed it. Includes the
      Supermatter, mouse squeaking, clown honking, footsteps, generic item attacks
      musical instruments, and a few other minor items
  - code_imp: documents the entire sound looping system, adds functionality for further
      sound loops in the future
