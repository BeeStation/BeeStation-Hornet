changes:
  - rscadd: 'All station incinerators now utilize the breakthrough new anti-radiation
      technology of Depleted Uranium! Incident #36690, #39352, #40930, and others
      anomalies should now be _99.99%_ totally preventable!'
  - tweak: Repiped corg incinerator in its entirety. Its waste pipe now has a pipenet
      route to a space outlet or TEG. Minor simplifications to Meta incinerator
  - tweak: I standardized the layout of some of the turbines. They are supposedly
      cookie-cutter technology just brought over and welded onto their respective
      station, and it gave me the opportunity to cut out some of the unnecessary piping
      bullshit(looking at you meta) that overcomplicated the turbine's purpose. None
      of my changes (save corg) should effect the turbine's actual functionality of
      put gas in, filter it out.
  - balance: rwalls of some incinerators have been replaced with iron walls to decrease
      stifling of atmosian creativity. Technically a balance change as it makes incinerators
      easier to break into. Technically...
  - admin: Accidental radleaks much less likely. "Why didnt you burn that risky mix
      where there is equipment to handle it", is now a viable question to ask griefers.
