changes:
  - refactor: Fully heal can be passed a series of flags. As a result, some things
      which previously did a full heal might heal slightly less, or some things which
      did partial full heals might do slightly more.
  - bugfix: Adminordrazine will no longer completely break every facet of a person
  - admin: Ahealing a changeling will refill all of their chems.
