changes:
  - tweak: Raised Dynamic costs for most midround antagonists to better represent
      their impact.
  - tweak: Added HIGH_IMPACT flags to Blob and Xenos, meaning they typically will
      not coincide in the same round.
  - tweak: Added living antagonist percentage checks to all midround injections, scaling
      with population. This means if there are too many currently active antagonists,
      Dynamic will not inject any midrounds.
  - tweak: Lowered dynamic security requirements across the board, to allow for a
      better variety of antagonists on lowpop rather than defaulting to excessive
      amounts of traitors.
