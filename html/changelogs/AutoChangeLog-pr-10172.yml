changes:
  - code_imp: cleaned up some anomaly codes, and separated the file into multiple
      dm
  - rscadd: Sanity Disruptor Anomaly! This will appear at +30 pops with a little bit
      high chance. Sadly, this doesn't have a core. The anomaly will pulse to make
      you stunned, blinded, and a little bit hallucinated. Although it's almost harmless.
  - bugfix: Fixed the original insanity pulse artifact can't send more pulses when
      it reaches the end of the world map where the item exists. Also, fixed a pulse
      triggers the effect on a mob twice as it included a turf twice.
  - code_imp: new turf calculation proc get_edge_turfs() -- By PowerfulBacon
