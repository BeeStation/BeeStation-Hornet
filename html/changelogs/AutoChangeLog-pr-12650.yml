changes:
  - bugfix: Wabbajacking a shapeshifted mob no longer runtimes horribly. When a shapeshifted
      mob is wabbajacked, they'll now be removed from their shapeshift and stunned.
  - bugfix: Transforming via a shapeshift should no longer rob you of your hearing
      / runechat awareness.
  - bugfix: Shapeshifting plays nicer with holoparasites.
  - bugfix: Being polymorphed from a xeno to a non-xeno correctly makes you a non-xeno
  - refactor: Refactored shapeshifting, the shapeshift holder is now a status effect
      instead of an object.
  - refactor: Heretic worm form is a shapeshift spell now, this might have some minor
      behavioral changes but should overall be the same.
  - refactor: Refactored Wabbajack (+ cursed pool). Overall a bit more clean / consistent
      behavior.
