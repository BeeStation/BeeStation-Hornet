  - bugfix: fix clockwork armor error worn_states. No more pink drip
  - bugfix: bows arent invisible anymore. The code is still ugly, sorry
  - bugfix: Ion rifles have their emissivity back
  - code_imp: added a bunch of error icons to clothing icon files. Less invisible
      stuff, more people wearing ugly stuff for them to report so it can be fixed
