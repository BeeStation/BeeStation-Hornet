changes:
  - bugfix: Abductor teleportation is no longer blocked by the teleporting agent.
  - tweak: Abductor teleport console is now blocked by mobs within 5 tiles rather
      than mobs that can see the location, to make it less frustrating to find a valid
      warp point.
  - balance: Abductor emergency teleport now applies sleeping rather than stun.
