changes:
  - bugfix: Geysers no longer generate in ruins. In fact, nothing should generate
      in ruins, as ruins now generate before other things.
  - tweak: Due to changes in the way the map is setup, floors that are parts of ruins
      on lavaland loaded at roundstart will now deconstruct into lava instead of basalt
      floors.
  - code_imp: When a template is loaded with a passthrough turf, non-passthrough area
      on it, onto a genturf, the genturf is now forced to generate with the old area.
      This allows ruins to have objects in a powered area on a passthrough turf on
      lavaland.
  - code_imp: Passthrough turfs can now hint towards if the turf below should be closed/open
      (wall/floor). This can be useful in ruins, as it can influence map generation
      without overriding the exact turf placed underneath.
  - imageadd: Sprites for passthrough turfs with closed/open preferrence (visible
      in editor only)
