			<h2 class="date">21 May 2023</h2>
			<h3 class="author">CydiaLamiales updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Increased the time window for cancelling/changing random events and midround injections from 10 to 30 seconds</li>
				<li class="soundadd">Added a new sound - adminalert.ogg</li>
				<li class="admin">Added a new preference for hearing admin alert sounds</li>
				<li class="admin">Added a sound for the 'x event happening in y seconds' chat message</li>

				<li class="server">TGS DMAPI bumped to 6.4.3</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">20 May 2023</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Absolucy updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Advanced/experimental blood filtering now actually requires the appropriate tech.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Max-tier blood filtering surgery actually heals toxin now.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a description to all variations of blood filtering surgery.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">RKz, Jacquerel updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">New foodtype, GORE. Split from GROSS, GORE foodtype will be replacing it where the food in particular resembles a corpse or organ. GROSS should only apply to inedible or rotting foods.</li>
				<li class="balance">All butchered player species are considered to be gore, only preferred by Lizards, Felinids, and Flies. If you like the taste of your fellow crew, prepare accordingly.</li>
				<li class="balance">Moved food preferences around to make more sense with the current system. Nothing drastic, but species liked foods should be much more immersive in general.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Rukofamicom updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Adds a new type of reagent, metabolites. Metabolites are produced as a byproduct of any reagent with a metabolite set and can be used to trace what kinds of reagents someone has been exposed to at least somewhat recently. For now metabolites are only implemented for Bicaridine, Kelotane, Antitoxin, Tricordrazine, Styptic Powder and Silver Sulfadiazine.</li>
				<li class="balance">Bicaridine, Kelotane, Antitoxin and Tricordrazine are equally effective regardless of current HP again, instead having their effects wane as metabolites build up. They will always be useful, but will never be the only thing you need to treat more severe injuries.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Bruise packs and ointment now utilize reagent code to heal instead of directly healing. Due to overdosing concerns, they heal for half as much per application, but come with twice as many applications per stack to compensate.</li>
				<li class="balance">Because they now properly utilize medicine, ointments and bruise packs are now very painful! Players will find they are unable to subject themselves to this pain if they try to apply more than one in quick succession. Seek help from others if you need multiple applications!</li>
				<li class="tweak">Gauze can now heal injured simplemobs just like bruise packs.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">itsmeow updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Martial arts granting books (karate scroll, CQC manual, etc) no longer break permanently if you interrupt it last second.</li>

			<h3 class="author">Absolucy updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">

				<li class="tweak">Made the confirmation for clearing all chem recipes a part of the tgui itself.</li>

				<li class="tweak">All species can now *wag their tail if they have one.</li>
				<li class="refactor">Slightly refactored brain trauma.</li>

				<li class="tweak">mimic mobs (especially, animating venders) will become back to how it was. For Brand Intelligence event, dead mimics will become a destroyed vending machine</li>
				<li class="tweak">Brand Intelligence targeted vendors no longer explode when the event happens. These will become a stronger version instead. (i.e. more HP, more damage, etc) Otherwise, vending machine mobs have slightly less HP.</li>
				<li class="tweak">mimic crate will eat items on where it is spawned - including important items like a nuke disk. Still, nuke disk is trackable, and dead mimic will let things out. (Admins can use this to contain stuff into a mimic crate by spawning that mob - but items should be placed on it.)</li>

				<li class="rscadd">The Codex Cicatrix is no longer a roundstart heretic item. Research is handled through an action button. Rune drawing is done by using a writing tool with Mansus Grasp active in your offhand. The actual Codex is an unlockable ritual item now.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Living Heart is no longer a roundstart heretic item - their actual heart now becomes their Living Heart, and it makes a sound when triggered. Losing your heart (being disemboweled) will require you to do a ritual to regain it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Hereic Antag UI has been overhauled, and now hosts much of their mechanics as well as providing some helpful tips for newer players.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Most heretic spells now require a focus to cast. All heretics can make a basic focus necklace, and some heretic equipment also functions as a focus. (Credit to Imaginos for the focus sprite!)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Heretics now passively gain +1 influence every 20 minutes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Heretic sacrificing has been reworked. You can now sacrifice people who are in soft crit or weaker.

				<li class="rscadd">Heretics now have a few new rituals, including the Ritual of Knowledge, a randomly generated ritual that awards knowledge points.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Heretic ascension now has a few requirements - you must complete your objectives assigned to you prior to learning the final ritual, and all the final rituals have been changed a bit!</li>
				<li class="tweak">Used heretic influences can now be removed with a Anomaly Neutralizers.</li>
				<li class="balance">Some heretic rituals are now limited in the amount they can make. You can only have up to 2 heretic blades crafted at once (3 if you are Path of Flesh).</li>
				<li class="balance">The Lord of the Night has been buffed to be a little scarier. Did you know the Lord of the Night can eat arms to regain body parts and heal?</li>
				<li class="balance">Buffed some heretic summons - mostly their health pools.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed quite a few bugs and unintended behaviors with heretic code.</li>
				<li class="refactor">Refactored and improved much of Heretic code. Improved the file structure dramatically.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Heretics can no longer hijack the Emergency Shuttle</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Heretic Smugglers (latejoin heretics) actually spawn influences</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixes a few potential issues with heretic rituals.</li>
				<li class="code_imp">Adds proper stack support to heretic rituals. Also allows for more specific "ritual failure" feedback.</li>
				<li class="code_imp">Added an isstack helper</li>
				<li class="tweak">heretic sacrifices will drop their legcuffs before entering the minigame (bolas, bear traps)</li>
				<li class="balance">Heretic: The Amber Focus is now fireproof.</li>
				<li class="balance">Heretic: The Eldritch Medallion (thermal vision necklace) is now fireproof, acid proof, and works as a focus.</li>
				<li class="balance">Heretic: The Void Cloak can carry more things in its pocket, including various ritual components (organs, bodyparts, flowers), small heretic items, and a singular sickly blade. It also functions as a focus while the hood is down.</li>
				<li class="balance">Heretic: Mawed Crucible potions are now small sized (down from normal).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Heretic rituals overhauled slightly. You now pick from a list of all your rituals when invoking a rune to select what ritual you want to do.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Minor fixes for the Heretic's Living Heart ritual. Cybernetic organs are now properly detected.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Similarly, you cannot feed the mawed crucible cybernetic organs.</li>
