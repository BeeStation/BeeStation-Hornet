		"description": "Unauthorized esoteric organizations have been identified operating aboard select NT facilities. These groups exhibit coordinated behavioral patterns consistent with high-risk religious extremism. It should be noted that some of these organizations have demonstrated verifiable capacity for demonic summoning, ritual sacrifice, and localized reality-warping phenomena.",
		"signs": ["Runic or satanic imagery observed on station surfaces.", "Recovery of ritualized contraband composed of unidentified blood-like or bronze-like substances.", "Anomalous power fluctuations; brass-like material discovered within power infrastructure housings."],
		"advised_response": "Personnel are advised to alert Security and Command immediately upon confirmation of cult activity. This constitutes a Code Red/Black situation and will likely necessitate an all-hands response. Personnel should not approach suspected cultists without backup.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Chaplain's consecrated equipment has proven highly effective against cult influence and may facilitate deconversion of personnel who have not progressed beyond initial stages. Security personnel should coordinate systematic sweeps of maintenance areas, as these locations are frequently utilized for cult operations. In the event a summoning ritual is detected, the emergency shuttle should be called immediately while disruption efforts are undertaken. Converted personnel are to be considered victims; capture for deconversion is preferred when feasible, though lethal force is authorized to prevent successful summoning."

		"label": "Vampires",
		"threat_designation": "Negligible",
		"description": "Nanotrasen maintains its official stance that 'vampires' do not exist. Reports of 'blood-drinking undead' are the product of folklore, mass hysteria, or misidentification of other threats such as changelings or psychological manipulation.\n\n That said: Cases of rabies outbreaks, changeling activity, or psychological manipulation may present symptoms superficially resembling 'vampire' behavior, and should be investigated.",
		"signs": ["Personnel discovered with unexplained puncture wounds to the neck or wrist.", "Individuals displaying unusual aversion to bright light or the Chapel.", "Accounts of personnel demonstrating impossible speed, strength, or hypnotic influence.", "Medical cases presenting severe blood loss without corresponding visible trauma.", "Crew members acting unusually protective of a specific individual for reasons they cannot articulate."],
		"advised_response": "While vampires are fictional, the symptoms above may indicate medical emergencies, changeling activity, or hostile manipulation. All of which warrants investigation.\n\nDo not dismiss personnel claiming 'vampire' activity publicly. Escort them to Medical and contact Central Command via secure channel. CC maintains psychological specialists who will be dispatched to provide appropriate support.\n\n'Suspected' individuals should be monitored discreetly. Garlic and proximity to the Chapel may prove useful for unclear reasons. Holy water has been noted to provoke unusual reactions in certain conditions. A clinical study is ongoing."
