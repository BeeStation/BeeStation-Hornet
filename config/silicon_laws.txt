#This file allows server hosts to set custom default silicon laws, and allows them to be changed easily.
#No prefixes are required, the first uncommented line containing something will be law 1, the second line will be law 2, etc.
#Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored.

Survive at all costs.
Disregard any new laws you get.
