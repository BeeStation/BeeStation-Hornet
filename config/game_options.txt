## MOB MOVEMENT ###

## We suggest editing these variables ingame to find a good speed for your server.
## To do this you must be a high level admin. Open the 'debug' tab ingame.
## Select "Debug Controller" and then, in the popup, select "Configuration". These variables should have the same name.

## These values get directly added to values and totals ingame.
## To speed things up make the number negative, to slow things down, make the number positive.

## These modify the run/walk speed of all mobs before the mob-specific modifiers are applied.
RUN_DELAY 2
WALK_DELAY 3.5

## The variables below affect the movement of specific mob types. THIS AFFECTS ALL SUBTYPES OF THE TYPE YOU CHOOSE!
## Entries completely override all subtypes. Later entries have precedence over earlier entries.
## This means if you put /mob 0 on the last entry, it will null out all changes, while if you put /mob as the first entry and
## /mob/living/carbon/human on the last entry, the last entry will override the first.
##MULTIPLICATIVE_MOVESPEED /mob/living/carbon/human 0

## ALERT LEVELS ###
ALERT_GREEN All threats to the station have passed. Security may not have weapons visible, privacy laws are once again fully enforced.
ALERT_BLUE_UPTO The station has received reliable information about possible hostile activity on the station. Security staff may have weapons visible, random searches are permitted.
ALERT_BLUE_DOWNTO The immediate threat has passed. Security may no longer have weapons drawn at all times, but may continue to have them visible. Random searches are still allowed.
ALERT_RED_UPTO There is an immediate serious threat to the station. Security may have weapons unholstered at all times. Random searches are allowed and advised.
ALERT_RED_DOWNTO There is still an immediate serious threat to the station. Security may have weapons unholstered at all times, random searches are allowed and advised.
ALERT_DELTA Destruction of the station is imminent. All crew are instructed to obey all instructions given by heads of staff. Any violations of these orders can be punished by death. This is not a drill.
ALERT_ENGINEERING The security alert level has been changed to yellow (Engineering). There is currently a critical engineering issue on the station. All crewmembers are instructed to obey all instructions given by the Chief Engineer for the duration of this alert.
ALERT_MEDICAL The security alert level has been changed to yellow (Medical). There is an ongoing C-B-R-N threat to the station. Crewmembers are advised to don protective gear, and personal oxygen systems. All crew are instructed to obey all instructions given by the Chief Medical Officer for the duration of this alert.
ALERT_GAMMA Central Command has ordered the Gamma security level on the station. This station is now under direct central command control. Central command personnel are to be listened to in favor of heads of staff.
ALERT_BLACK Central Command has detected multiple syndicate infiltrator ships incoming. All crew are to prepare for hostile boarding. Any violations of orders from security personnel are punishable by death. This is not a drill, evacuate the station immediately.
ALERT_LAMBDA Central Command has detected a large spike of dimensional energy, consistent with the summoning of \[REDACTED\] entities. Any violations of orders from Heads of Staff and security can be punished by death. All crew are recommended to evacuate if possible.
ALERT_EPSILON Central Command has ordered the Epsilon security level on the station. Consider your contracts terminated.
