# This workflow was added in the 515 compatibility PR - https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/71161
# By having this in your repository, we know that you have that PR merged as well.
# This will be REMOVED when 515 is fully compatible and ready, but for now we need this
# to prevent merge skew.
# In the future, this will be a more proper system where commits can be added into a text file,
# but that's a lot more difficult and I'm in a huge time crunch right now.
