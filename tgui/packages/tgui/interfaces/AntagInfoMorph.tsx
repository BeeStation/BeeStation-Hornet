              You may take the form of anything you can see by <span style={noticestyle}>shift-clicking</span> it. Disguising
              yourself will alert nearby observers and your <span style={badstyle}>disguise will be broken </span>
              for 20 seconds if you are attacked or perform an attack. You may also willingly drop your disguise by{' '}
              <span style={noticestyle}>shift-clicking</span> yourself.

              You move slower while morphed, but can surprise creatures with an <span style={goodstyle}>ambush attack </span>
              by clicking on them or by fooling them with a tempting disguise that convinces them to willingly interact with you
              using an open hand. Ambushes will cause your victim to drop anything they are holding and knock them down. If they
              attempted to interact with you using an open hand it will also{' '}
              <span style={goodstyle}>inject a debilitating venom </span>
              making them easy prey for consumption. <br />
              <br />
              You can consume any dead or dying creatures as well as loose items by clicking them. Digesting anything will
              <span style={goodstyle}> restore your health</span>, but dead creatures and food will restore more.
              <br />

              You can crawl through the station&apos;s vents and scrubbers by <span style={noticestyle}>alt-clicking</span>{' '}
              them.
