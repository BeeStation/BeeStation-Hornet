                    You are a creature from beyond the stars that has incredibly strong powers in the darkness, becoming nigh
                    unbeatable. Unfortunately, you wither and burn away in the light. You must use your

                  Move often. The station will be hunting you after you are discovered, so don&apos;t stay in one area for long.
                  <br />
                  <span style={tipstyle}>Tip #2:&ensp;</span>
                  Pick unfair fights. You are incredibly strong in one versus one situations, use it. The more you fight, the
                  harder it will be to keep it dark.
                  <br />
                  <span style={tipstyle}>Tip #3:&ensp;</span>
                  Fully destroy APCs when possible. Instead of hunting lights that can be fixed, hunt the APCs which are harder
                  to repair.
